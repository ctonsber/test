9.0 Model Output
================

This chapter provides information on the following:

-  Reading,

-  Visualizing,

-  Exporting, and

-  Working with model outputs.

Different options to display, customize, and export the simulation
results are described in the following sections.

9.1 Read Results and Export Results as Text File
------------------------------------------------

The “\ *Read Results*\ ” function is used to read the simulated-head
output file. The simulated heads are stored in a file with a .PLB
extension in binary format. The “\ *Read Results”* function reads the
results for simulated time steps. To visualize and export the simulation
results, click “\ *Results*\ ” from the Main Menu and then choose
“\ *Read Results*.” Select the .PLB file from the folder where
**MINEDW** was executed. There is another option for result files
(e.g., a .PLT file) in the “\ *Open Result File*\ ” dialog box. The .PLT
file is an older text-file format used by previous versions of
**MINEDW**. The .PLT file is no longer created by **MINEDW** during
a model run but can be created using the *“Export Results as Text
File*\ ” function. When using the “\ *Export Results as Text File”*
function, a .PLB file can be converted to a .PLT file. First, the .PLB
file must be imported using the “\ *Read Results”* function. Then, using
the “\ *Export Results as Text File”* function, a .PLT file can be
created. To view model results at a desired time step, enter the time
step in the variable field of the time-step slider or move the time-step
slider to the desired time step.

9.2 Observations
----------------

Observation locations can be defined using the “\ *Observations*\ ”
function. This information is used to create the hydrographs for
user-specified locations. In **MINEDW**, observations are input as
either “\ *Monitoring Boreholes*\ ” with screened intervals or as
“\ *Piezometers*\ ” with measurements at discrete *x*, *y*, and *z*
locations. “\ *Piezometers*\ ” differ from “\ *Monitoring*
*Boreholes*\ ” because results are extracted from a discrete *x*, *y*,
and *z* location, whereas “\ *Monitoring Boreholes*\ ” extract results
that have been averaged along a screened vertical interval.

To add a new monitoring borehole, select the “\ *Monitoring Borehole*\ ”
tab and then click “\ *Add*\ ” at the right of the dialog box. A new
entry is added. Enter the name of the monitoring borehole and the
corresponding “\ *X*\ ” and “\ *Y*\ ” as well as *“Screen Top”* and
*“Screen Bottom”* information. The information required for monitoring
wells is described below. The “\ *Add*,” “\ *Insert*,” and
“\ *Delete*\ ” buttons on the right of the “\ *Monitoring Borehole*\ ”
tab add or delete monitoring boreholes.

	The *y* coordinate of the monitoring borehole (m or ft).

Screen Top: 
	Elevation at the top of the screen (m or ft).

Screen Bottom: 
	Elevation at the bottom of the screen (m or ft).

To add a new piezometer, select the “\ *Piezometer*\ ” tab and then
click “\ *Add*\ ” at the top of the dialog box. This adds a new
“\ *Piezometer*\ ” group to the model, but no observations can be
extracted unless individual piezometers are added to the group. Under
each piezometer, different measurement points can be input (e.g.,
multi-level piezometers). To add individual measurement points, click
“\ *Add*\ ” on the lower right of the “\ *Edit Observations*\ ” dialog
box and a new blank entry is added. Enter the name of the piezometer and
the corresponding *x*, *y*, and *z* location.

To navigate between different piezometers, a drop-down menu is available
at the top. The “\ *Add*,” “\ *Insert*,” and “\ *Delete*\ ” buttons at
the top of the “\ *Piezometer*\ ” tab add or delete piezometer groups.

The information required for a piezometer is described below.

	The *z* coordinate of the piezometer (m or ft).

At the base of the “\ *Edit Observation*\ ” menu, the user can import or
export observation files using the “\ *Import”* and *“Export”* buttons.

9.3 Hydrograph
--------------

To create hydrographs from simulation results, use the
“\ *Hydrograph*\ ” function under the “\ *Results*\ ” drop-down menu.
Ensure that model results have been imported from the .PLB file. In the
“\ *Create Hydrograph File”* dialog box that opens, choose a directory
to export the hydrograph file to and enter a name, then click *“Save.”*
The groundwater-head data from monitoring boreholes and piezometers are
then exported to a .DAT file. This file will include time steps,
corresponding dates, well identification (ID), and corresponding
groundwater-head data for all of the time steps. If the monitoring
location becomes dewatered during the simulation, i.e., the groundwater
head drops below the monitoring level, the hydrograph file will contain
*“unsat”* appended to the head value. Also, if the monitoring location
is mined out during the simulation, the hydrograph file will contain
*“mined”* appended to the head value for that location. Data from this
file can easily be plotted using Microsoft Excel\ :sup:`TM` or another
plotting software, as shown in Figure 9.3.

9.4 Particle Tracking
---------------------

The particle tracking function (Figure 9.4) in **MINEDW** allows the
user to investigate potential capture zones for pumping wells or the
general movement of groundwater in the system. Particle tracks are
calculated after a model run is completed using data stored in the .PLB
file. The information required for particle tracking simulations is
described below.

To use the particle-tracking function, first import the .PLB file using
the *“Read Results…”* function under the *“Results”* menu. Next, open
the *“Particle Tracking”* dialog box by clicking on *“Particle
Tracking…”* under the *“Results”* menu. In the open dialog box, define
the *“Start/End Time”* for particle tracking, the amount of time to
track the particles in the box next to *“Tracking Time (days),”* and the
*“Step Size (m).”* Choose “\ *Forward”* or “\ *Backward*\ ” for the type
of particle tracking. To add particles, click *“Add,”* which is to the
right of the *“Particle Tracking”* dialog box. This creates an entry
where the *x*, *y*, and *z* location of the start or end of the particle
track can be defined. When all the particles have been added, click the
button next to “\ *Result Output*\ ”; this opens the *“Particle-Tracking
Results”* dialog box. Using this dialog box, choose the location to save
the particle-track file and enter a name for the file, then click
“\ *Save.”* Finally, click “\ *OK”* to create the particle-tracking
file.

To visualize the particle tracks created in the preceding steps,
navigate to the *“Post Processing”* plot items on the *“List”* tab of
the *“Control Panel”* Pane and add a *“Particle Tracking”* plot item.
Click the icon next to *“File”* on the “\ *Attribute”* tab to open the
*“Select Particle-Tracking File”* dialog box. Using this dialog box,
navigate to the location where the particle-tracking file was saved;
select it and click *“Open.”* The particle tracks appear in the View
Pane. The options described in Section 3.4.1.10 can be used to customize
the particle tracks as needed.

9.5 Section Flux
----------------

This function calculates groundwater flux across a cross-sectional area
defined by the user. The inputs, as displayed in Figure 9.6, are *x* and
*y* coordinates of the start and end points of the cross-sectional area
as well as the *z* coordinates of the top and bottom of the area across
which flux will be calculated. When *“Calculate”* is pressed,
**MINEDW** will calculate the flux in m\ :sup:`3`/day or
ft\ :sup:`3`/day and display the result in the bottom of the dialog box.
Click *“OK”* to close the *“Section Flux”* dialog box.

   Figure 9.6 The “\ *Section Flux”* dialog box

9.6 Seepage Component to Pit
----------------------------

**MINEDW** provides the user with a function to compute seepage to the
pit and a plot item to view the locations where seepage is occurring.
Seepage to the pit is recorded in a file with an .SEP extension. Seepage
recorded in this file includes seepage during mining operations and
seepage during pit-lake formation. Seepage is recorded for each time
step at each node that forms the open pit. Using the “\ *Seepage
Component to Pit*\ ” function and the .SEP file, the user can compute
seepage to the pit by geological unit or by another user-specified
division. This output can be plotted or used in geochemical modeling for
pit-lake chemistry predictions. With the “\ *Pit Flux”* plot item and
the .SEP file, the user can visualize the locations and relative
magnitude of seepage that is occurring at any time step after the start
of mining. This output may be used to assess future dewatering needs and
optimum locations for in-pit dewatering solutions. The “\ *Seepage
Component to Pit*\ ” function and “\ *Flux”* plot item are explained in
the following sections.

9.6.1 Calculating Seepage to the Pit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The “\ *Seepage Component to Pit*\ ” function computes the total seepage
to the pit and contributions of each geologic unit to total seepage
through time. To compute seepage to the pit, click “\ *Results*\ ” on
the Main Menu banner, and then choose “\ *Seepage Component to Pit*.”
The “\ *Seepage Component to Pit*\ ” dialog box appears (Figure 9.7).
Select the .SEP file from the folder where **MINEDW** was executed.
Choose “\ *Geological Units*\ ” to determine the seepage rate from each
geologic unit. To define an output name and location, click the button
at the bottom right box. The “\ *Save Pit Flow File*\ ” dialog box
appears (Figure 9.8).

Type a name at the bottom of the window and click “\ *Save*.” In the
following dialog box, click “\ *OK*.” The seepage file is then created.

The created file can be imported to Microsoft Excel\ :sup:`TM` or other
graphing software in which total seepage versus time (Figure 9.9) and
seepage from each geologic unit through time (Figure 9.10) can be
plotted.

9.6.2 Visualizing Seepage and Drains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As previously mentioned, it is possible to visualize the location where
seepage to the pit is occurring, as shown in Figure 9.11. To do this,
expand the *“Post Processing”* item under the *“List”* tab in the
“\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane. Add a *“Flux”* plot item to the View Pane by
double-clicking it. On the *“Attributes”* tab for the *“Flux”* plot
item, select “\ **+**\ ” next to the *“File”* attribute. In the *“Select
Flux File”* dialog box that opens, change the type of file to *“Seepage
Flux Files (mdw\_output.SEP)”* using the drop-down list next to *“Files
of Type.”* Now navigate to the location where the model was executed and
select the file ending in .SEP. The nodes where seepage to the pit
occurred are visible as colored squares. The colors indicate the
magnitude of seepage occurring at the node forming part of the open pit.
The size and color ramp can be modified on the attributes tab of the
“\ *Flux”* plot item.

.. figure:: media/figure_9_11_manual.png
   :width: 6.00000in
   :height: 3.60320in
   :align: center

   Figure 9.11 Visualizing seepage locations within the open pit

The *“Flux”* plot item can also be used to visualize the magnitude of
flow through *“Drain”* boundary conditions. Seepage nodes that form the
pit shell are considered drains and are automatically created when a
mine plan is created (Section 7.6). *“Drains,”* in contrast, are created
by the user and can be used to simulate sinks such as underground
excavation, sub-horizontal drains, and sumps. The workflow for
visualizing “\ *Drains”* is similar to the workflow for seepage, with
one exception: instead of choosing “\ *mdw\_output.SEP,”* select the
“\ *mdw\_output.DRN”* option if it is not already selected, then
navigate to the .DRN file and select it. Flow through user-created
drains is displayed in the View Pane. The size and color of the drain
nodes can be altered using the “\ *Contour”* and “\ *Point”* attributes.

9.7 Pit Node Elevation and Water Table
--------------------------------------

**MINEDW** enables the user to plot pit node elevations and the water
table beneath the pit over time. Click “\ *Results*\ ” from the Main
Menu banner, and then choose “\ *Pit Node Elevation and Water Table*.”
The “\ *Elevation of Pit Node*\ ” dialog box appears (Figure 9.12).
Enter the “\ *Node Number*\ ” on the left and click “\ *View*.” For the
specified node, the changes in the water table beneath the node and the
pit-surface elevation are plotted as shown in Figure 9.12.

.. figure:: media/figure_9_12_manual.png
   :width: 6.00000in

   :align: center

   Figure 9.12 The “\ *Elevation of Pit Node*\ ” dialog box

If multiple nodes are to be plotted, click “\ *Add*\ ” and insert
additional node numbers. Then click “\ *View.*\ ”

9.8 Export State
----------------

Data from **MINEDW** simulations can be exported for all of the nodes
to a .DAT file. 2-D data, which include “\ *X*,” “\ *Y*,”
“\ *Elevation*,” “\ *Head*,” “\ *Pressure*,” “\ *Water* *Table*,”
“\ *Drawdown*,” and “\ *Head* *Difference,*\ ” can be exported for each
model layer. For 3-D data, the options are 1) “\ *X*,” 2) “\ *Y*,” 3)
“\ *Elevation*,” 4) “\ *Head*,” 5) “\ *Pressure*,” and 6) “\ *Head*
*Difference.*\ ” To export these data in 2-D or 3-D, choose “\ *Export
State*\ ” from the “\ *Results*\ ” drop-down menu. Using the “\ *Choose
Export Items*\ ” dialog box (Figure 9.13), select the appropriate data
set in *“2-D”* or *“3-D”* and then click *“OK”* to generate the file.
Note, if neither the *“X”* nor *“Y”* box is checked, the data are
exported as a list of values. The coordinates associated with these
values correspond to the nodes in the model for the selected time step.
They are ordered using the same order as nodes in the “node.fem” file
(i.e., 1 to *n*) generated by **MINEDW**. Alternatively, checking the
boxes next to *“X,” “Y,”* and “\ *Elevation*\ ” adds coordinates for
each of the exported data values.

the grid space), then click “\ *OK*.” The pore pressures are
interpolated to the defined grid and are saved in a .DAT file. The .DAT
file includes *x* and *y* coordinates as well as pore pressures.

9.11 Drawdown-Base Time Step
----------------------------

The “\ *Drawdown-Base Time Step*\ ” option enables users to select a
date from which drawdown is calculated. In most cases, the initial date
is the first time step of the simulation. If the drawdown is to be
calculated using a different time step, then the date for the first time
step should be entered. Select “\ *Drawdown-Base Time Step*\ ” from the
“\ *Results*\ ” drop-down menu to open the “\ *Define Drawdown Initial
Date/Time*\ ” dialog box (Figure 9.18).

9.12 Visualizing the Results
----------------------------

**MINEDW** offers different options for presenting the simulation
results graphically. The “\ *Control Panel*\ ” options can be used to
display the results. Choose the “\ *Node*\ ” plot items under the
“\ *List*\ ” tab in the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane to produce both 2-D
and 3-D contours. Using “\ *2D Contour”* plot items, 2-D color floods of
head, pore pressure, head difference, water table, and drawdown can be
produced. Using “\ *3D Contour”* plot items, 3-D contours of head, pore
pressure, and head difference can be created. The display for each of
these plots can be customized using the *“Attributes”* tab in the
“\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane (Chapter 3). The figures below are examples
of the 2-D and 3-D plots (Figures 9.19 and 9.20).

the “\ *Attribute*\ ” tab from the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane and select
“\ *Pressure*\ ” from the “\ *Color By*\ ” setting. Pore pressures are
visible in the View Pane. By changing the time step on the time-step
slider, the desired time step can be viewed.

9.13 Cross Sections
-------------------

Cross sections are useful because they allow the user to visualize
different types of data together at any point within the model domain.
For example, a user may wish to view a cross section of the open pit
showing geological units overlaid by contours of pore pressure, head, or
head difference. This can be achieved by using the “\ *3D Element*,”
“\ *Isosurface,”* and “\ *Plane”* plot items.

To draw a cross section, the first step is to plot the desired “\ *3D
Contour*\ ” (*Elevation*, *Head*, *Pressure,* or *Head Difference*) or
“\ *3D Element*\ ” plot item. Model geology and pore pressures are used
as an example; however, similar steps can be followed to plot a cross
section of any other model results.

To view model geology and pore pressures, select the “\ *List*\ ” tab
from the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane, expand the “\ *Element”* item, and
double-click *“3D Element.”* Now, add an “\ *Isosurface*\ ” plot item
(be sure to import results) by expanding the “\ *Node*\ ” item and
double-clicking *“Isosurface”* (Figure 9.23). On the *“Attributes”* tab
for the *“Isosurface”* plot item, select “\ *Pressure*\ ” as the
“\ *Color By*\ ” attribute. A 3-D color flood of model geology with
*“Isosurfaces”* of pore pressures appears in the View Pane, but the
*“Isosurfaces”* are not visible, as they are hidden by the *“3D
Element*.” Select the desired time step to view with the time-step
slider.

   Figure 9.23 The “\ *3D Element*\ ” and “\ *Isosurface*\ ” plot items

The easiest method for creating a cross section is to use the *“Plane”*
tool located on the Toolbar. To use it, click on it, then select two
points on the displayed *“3D Element*\ ” plot item. The *“3D Element”*
and *“Isosurface”* plot items will be cut by a plane that passes through
the two points that were selected.

Alternatively, create a cross section by selecting the “\ *List*\ ” tab
from the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane, expanding “\ *Cutting Planes,*\ ”
and double-clicking “\ *Plane*\ ” (Figure 9.24).

For both methods of creating a cross section, display the front or back
sections that have been cut (i.e., to turn a 2-D item into a 3-D item)
by selecting “\ *3D Element*\ ” from the list in the “\ *Plot Items*\ ”
pane and checking the box for “\ *Front*\ ” or “\ *Back*\ ” under
“\ *Cutplane*\ ” on the “\ *Attributes*\ ” tab (Figure 9.26).

The cross section will display model geology through the open-pit area
overlaid by contours of pore pressure (Figure 9.27). To export the plot
as a bitmap, select “\ *Export Base*\ ” under the “\ *File*\ ” menu and
choose the “\ *Bitmap*\ ” option.

9.14 Pit Lake – Water Level vs. Time
------------------------------------

The water-level change in a pit lake can be computed in **MINEDW** if
a pit lake is simulated in a model. To plot pit-lake level changes over
time, import the .LAK file (Appendix B) from the folder where
**MINEDW** was executed to *Microsoft Excel* :sup:`TM` or other
plotting software (Figure 9.28). The .LAK file also contains other
useful information about the pit lake. This file contains the net flux
to the pit lake as well as seepage to and from the pit lake. Evaporative
losses, volume, and lake area are also recorded in this file. Note that
these data are only recorded in time steps during which a pit lake is
active. If seepage to the pit occurs during mining operations, it is not
recorded in the .LAK file. This seepage data can be located in the .SEP
file (Section 9.6).

9.15 Pumping Well – Discharge vs. Time
--------------------------------------

Pumping rates are reported in the output file with an .FLW extension.
This file also contains the flux for each of the constant-head groups
defined in the “\ *Constant-Head Boundary*\ ” dialog box. The .FLW file
reports extraction of groundwater from the model as negative numbers and
addition of groundwater as positive numbers. Flux into or out of the
model domain is reported for each time step.
