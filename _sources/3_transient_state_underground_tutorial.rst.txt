Tutorial 3 - Underground Mining
===============================

3.1 Problem Description
-----------------------

Tutorial 3 uses the steady-state (pre-mining) model generated in
Tutorial 1 and describes how to construct a transient model for an
underground mine that uses the sublevel caving method. This tutorial
describes the procedure for creating an enhanced permeability zone for
displaced rocks caused by sublevel caving. This enhanced permeability
zone is referred to as the “zone of relaxation for caving” in this
tutorial. Incorporating this permeable zone into the model will be
discussed below.

3.2 Transient Simulation
------------------------

The results from the steady-state simulation in Tutorial 1 are used as
the initial conditions for the transient simulation.

Step 1. Opening the Project File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The model created in Tutorial 1 is used for this problem. To open the
project file created in the first tutorial, click “\ *File*\ ” on the
Main Menu banner, then select “\ *Open Project.*\ ” The “\ *Load a
MINEDW Project File*\ ” dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3.1.

Select the project (.PRJ) file and click “\ *Open.*\ ” Next, select
“\ *File*\ ” from the Main Menu banner and then select “\ *Save Project
As*\ ” to save the project as a different .PRJ file for the transient
underground simulation (e.g., UG.PRJ).

Step 2. Defining Project Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the project property, click “\ *Project*\ ” and then select
“\ *Project Property*.” The “\ *Project Properties*\ ” dialog box shown
in Figure 3.2 appears. Make sure all the fields contain the same values
as shown in Figure 3.2. Select the “\ *Transient*\ ” option for this
simulation.

Step 3. Defining Initial Heads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To define initial heads, click “\ *Project*\ ” on the Main Menu banner,
then select “\ *Initial Heads.*\ ” The “\ *Set Up Initial Head*\ ”
dialog box appears. Choose the “\ *Varied*\ ” option and select the
water levels file (“\*.MDL”) created during Tutorial 1 by clicking on
the “…” button as shown in Figure 3.3, then click “\ *OK.*\ ”

Step 4. Creating the ZOR file for Caving
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In **MINEDW**, the enhanced permeability of displaced rock as a result
of sublevel caving can be simulated. The two zones can be represented
with different *K* values for the displaced rock.

To create the enhanced permeability zone of displaced rock, select
“\ *Zone of Relaxation for Caving*\ ” from the “\ *Mining*\ ” drop-down
menu on the Main Menu banner. The “\ *Create Zone of Relaxation for Cave
Zone*\ ” dialog box appears (Figure 3.4).

   :align: center

   Figure 3.4 The “\ *Create Zone of Relaxation for Cave Zone*\ ” dialog
   box

First, enter or select the input data directory where the files you will
be working with are located. This can be done by entering the path
directly into the box next to “\ *Input Data Directory”* or by clicking
the “…” button and navigating to the location of the files. Next, enter
the dates of the mining schedule and the related .DXF file names in the
*“Date,” “Layer #1 File,”* and “\ *Layer #2 File”* columns manually or
use an underground-mining schedule file (Appendix B) to load data for
Years 0 to 9. To use an underground-mining schedule file to load dates
and file names, click on the “\ *Open*\ ” button and select the
“\ *UG.DAT*\ ” file found in the “\ *INPUT*\ ” folder. When the
“\ *UG.DAT*\ ” file is selected, the dates and file names will be listed
as shown in Figure 3.3. In this example, “\ *2000\_A.DXF*\ ” represents
a zone with the most displaced rock and “\ *2000\_B.DXF*\ ” represents a
second zone with less displaced rock for the first year of mining. The
other .DXF files are for subsequent years of mining.

Click “\ *Search Zone*,” and the geological units that are within the
displaced volume will appear. Leaving the value under the field labeled
“\ *Layer #...”* equal to 1 will exclude that geologic unit from the
ZOR. For this simulation, use values of 25 and 10 for *“Layer #1”* and
*“Layer #2,”* respectively. Select the folder where you wish to create
the zone of relaxation for caving file by clicking the *“…”* button and
navigating to the location. Next, enter the file name in the box at the
bottom of the dialog box and then click “\ *OK.*\ ”

Step 5. Adding the ZOR for Caving to the Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To include the block caving ZOR in the model, select “\ *Underground
Mining and Dewatering*\ ” under the “\ *Mining*\ ” drop-down menu on the
Main Menu banner. The “\ *Dewatering and Underground Mining*\ ” dialog
box appears (Figure 3.5). Click *“Add”* and then select the “\ *ZOR”*
tab. On the *“ZOR”* tab, click on *“Assign”* and, using the *“Open Time
Varied Conductivity File”* dialog box, browse to the location where the
ZOR file is located, select it, and click *“Open.”* After choosing the
ZOR file, make sure that the *“Activate”* box on the *“ZOR”* tab is
checked, then click *“OK.”* Multiple cave ZORs can be added to the model
using this dialog box.

Step 6. Adding the Drain Nodes for the Cave Zone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drain nodes are used to simulate groundwater extraction via the
underground workings. To add the drain nodes to the model for
simulation, begin by creating the necessary groups in the
*“Constant-Head Boundary”* dialog box. Click on *“BCs”* on the Main Menu
banner, then select *“Constant Head”* from the drop-down menu. Using the
*“Constant-Head* *Boundary”* dialog box, click *“Add”* in the top center
of the dialog box. Change the group name to *“2000”* for the first drain
group. Select *“Drain”* from the drop-down box next to the group name.
Repeat these steps to add drain groups *“2001”* through *“2009.”* Once
the groups have been created in the *“Constant-Head Boundary*\ ” dialog
box, click *“OK”* on the left-hand side of the dialog box.

The drain groups have been created in the model, but currently no drains
are assigned to the model domain. To correctly assign the drains to the
model to simulate the dewatering of the underground workings, begin by
adding the file named *“Mine\_Workings.DXF”* in the *“Input/Cave”*
directory to the View Pane. Using the *“Layer”* attribute, turn on only
the *“2000”* layer. Next, add a *“3D Contour”* plot item to the View
Pane. Toggle through the *“Layers,”* starting from layer 1, until the
top of the *“Mine\_Workings.DXF”* file becomes visible. Using the
*“Select”* tool on the Main Menu banner, select the nodes around this
portion of the *“Mine\_Workings.DXF”* file\ *.* Once the nodes are
selected, press [Enter] to open the *“Assign Properties for Nodes”*
dialog box. Check the radio button next to *“Add to Constant-Head
Boundary”* and then select the *“2000”* group from the constant-head
group drop-down box, then click *“OK.”* Repeat these steps for all of
the layers in the *“Mine\_Workings.DXF”* file. The results should look
similar to those displayed in Figure 3.6.

   Figure 3.6 The drain nodes used to simulate the underground workings

Once the drain nodes have been assigned to the model domain, the
activation time will need to modified for each one of the drain nodes.
Each drain group should be activated on the date indicated by the group
name to simulate the progressive excavation of the underground workings.
For example, group *“2000”* should be activated on 1 January 2000 and
group *“2001”* should be activated on 1 January 2001 and so on. All the
drain groups should cease operation on 1 January 2010 to simulate the
end of mining. To turn off the drain nodes, enter “\ *˗9,999,999*\ ” for
the drain level in the time-series window. Now that the underground mine
has been added to the model, they should be added as part of the mining
simulation.

Adding the created drain nodes to the mining simulation will instruct
**MINEDW** to summarize flow to these drain nodes in a special file
ending in *“\*.MNE.”* The summarized flow data in the *“\*.MNE”* file
could be calculated from the data reported in the *“\*.FLW*\ ” file, but
adding the drain nodes to the mining simulation simplifies these steps.
To add the drain nodes that are dewatering the underground workings to
the mining simulation, open the *“Dewatering and Underground Mining”*
dialog box by clicking *“Mining”* then selecting *“Underground Mining
and Dewatering”* on the Main Menu banner. Under the *“General”* tab in
the *“Dewatering and Underground Mining”* dialog box there is a
drop-down box next to the window titled *“Drain Group Used.”* The
drop-down box should contain the constant-head and drain groups that
were previously added to the model using the *“Constant-Head Boundary”*
dialog box. Select the *“2000”* group, then below the drop-down box,
click *“Add.”* The drain group name should now be visible in the *“Drain
Group Used”* window and should not appear in the drop-down box. Repeat
these steps for drain groups *“2001”* through *“2009.”* The completed
*“Dewatering and Underground Mining*\ ” dialog box should appear similar
to what is shown in Figure 3.7. Now the model is ready to run. Refer to
the following section for running the underground mining simulation.

3.5 Running the Model
---------------------

To run the model, click “\ *Run*\ ” on the Main Menu banner, then select
“\ *Validate.*\ ” If the model passes the validation process, then click
“\ *Run*\ ” on the Main Menu banner and select “\ *Create Data Set*.”
Select the folder where you want to create the data set. Next, click
“\ *Run*\ ” on the Main Menu banner and select “\ *Execute*\ ” to run
the model.

3.6 Results
-----------

Once the simulation has ended, click “\ *Results*\ ” on the Main Menu
banner, and then choose “\ *Read Results.*\ ” Select the “\*.\ *PLB*\ ”
file from the folder where **MINEDW** was executed to import the
simulation results into **MINEDW** for visualization. Next, add a *“3D
Contour”* plot item to the View Pane and use the time-step slider to
view the desired time step. Figure 3.8 displays a cross section of head
at the end of mining just before dewatering operations end.

As previously mentioned, **MINEDW** computes the total inflow to the
underground workings. This information is recorded in the file
“\*.\ *MNE*\ ” extension in the folder where **MINEDW** was executed.
To plot seepage to the underground workings below the cave zone, open
the “\*.\ *MNE*\ ” file using Microsoft\ :sup:`®` Excel or other
plotting software. Figure 3. 9 shows total inflow to the underground
workings.

For additional outputs that can be generated from a model simulation,
please refer to section 2.3. All of the outputs, with the exception of
the *“Pit Node Elevation and Water Table,” “Seepage Component to Pit,”*
and *“Pit Lake Water Level vs. Time,”* can be generated for the
underground mining simulation. This tutorial did not use pumping wells
for dewatering the underground mine; however, if pumping wells had been
used, the discharge over time could also be plotted. Discharge from
pumping wells is recorded in the file with the extension *“\*.FLW.”*
