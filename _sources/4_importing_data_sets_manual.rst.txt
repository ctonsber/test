4.0 Importing Data Sets
=======================

The **MINEDW** program can import **MINEDW** model data sets as well
as *FEFLOW* data sets.

4.1 Importing Earlier Versions of **MINEDW** Model Data Sets
------------------------------------------------------------

To import a **MINEDW** model data set or *FEFLOW* data set into
**MINEDW**, select “\ *File/Import*\ ” from the Main Menu banner at
the top of the screen. The “\ *Import File*\ ” dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 4.1.

When selecting a data file, five options are available: 1) **MINEDW**
geometry file (.PST), 2) **MINEDW** data-set file (.FEL), 3) *FEFLOW*
data-set file (.FEM), 4) *FEFLOW* results data file (.DAC), or 5)
stereolithography (.STL) file, which is used to import a finite-element
mesh. If a **MINEDW** geometry file (.PST) is selected, then only
geometry and zone information are imported; however, if a **MINEDW**
data-set file (.FEL) is selected, then all information related to the
model inputs is imported. After selecting the desired model data file,
click “\ *Open*\ ” to continue.

The **MINEDW** data-set file (.FEL) contains a list of references to
**MINEDW** model files, which must be in the same directory as the
.FEL file when the model is imported. If a .FEL file was created using a
prior version (e.g., before **MINEDW** **3.0**) of **MINEDW**,
then the “\ *Define Simulation Start Date/Time*\ ” dialog box appears
(as shown in Figure 4.2). If the **MINEDW** data set was created with
**MINEDW** version **3.0** or greater, the time-step information is
imported automatically.

   Figure 4.2 The “\ *Define Simulation Start Date/Time*\ ” dialog box

When importing data from a .FEL file created by versions prior to
**MINEDW** version **3.0**, the simulation start date refers to time
step = 0 in the simulation. After entering the simulation start date,
click “\ *OK*\ ” to complete the importing process. A progress window
appears (Figure 4.3), showing the completion percentage of the import.

Time-varying conductivity (e.g., ZOR) information cannot be imported
into **MINEDW** when importing from .FEL files created by **MINEDW**
prior to version **3.0** and has to be regenerated using the “\ *Open
Pit*\ ” menu.

4.2 Display the Imported Model
------------------------------

After the model files are imported, the model can be displayed using
plot items, as described in Chapter 3.
