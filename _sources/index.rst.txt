**MINEDW** is a three-dimensional (3D), finite-element, groundwater flow program that was developed specifically for mining applications. **MINEDW** is used worldwide to design dewatering or depressurization systems, predict local and regional environmental impacts of mine dewatering, assist in the design of water-supply systems, simulate the infilling of a “pit lake” after mining ceases, and estimate pore-pressure distributions within highwalls for geotechnical design purposes. Its user friendly graphical interface with pre- and post-processing functionality provides a powerful numerical modeling environment.

**MINEDW** is used at more than 50 mines throughout the world for mining-related applications in diverse hydrogeologic and climatic conditions.

Developed from FEMFLOW3D, **MINEDW** was validated by Sandia National Laboratories in 1998 and has been used at more than 50 mines world wide in diverse hydrogeologic and climatic conditions.

* Used at more than 50 mines throughout the world for mining-related issues in diverse hydrogeologic and climatic conditions;

* Simulates open-pit and underground mining for dewatering design and input to slope-stability analysis;

* 3-D graphic representations of geology, model domain, pit geometry, groundwater heads, and pore pressures;

* Simulates excavation and subsequent pit-lake infilling to represent different mining schedules; and

* Simulates interaction between groundwater and surface water.
