3.1 View Pane
-------------

View Panes are used to store plots and function as a window that can be
opened and closed. The View Pane without any plot items is defined as
the base View Pane as shown in Figure 3.1 The base View Pane is a
unique View Pane (there is only one) in that it is permanent and cannot
be closed, although it can be hidden from view.

The assembly of plot items within a View Pane is performed using the
Control Panel, which provides tools that can be used to define the
contents of the plot (plot items) and the appearance of those items. A
description of the Control Panel is provided in later sections. Plots
typically consist of a model mesh, geologic setting, wells, boundary
conditions, model outputs, and legend, as shown in Figure 3.2 Note that
the Control Panel is turned off in Figure 3.2 in order to illustrate the
View Pane.

The plot items in a specific View Pane can be saved in views using the
“\ *View*\ ” menu. There is no limit to the number of View Panes that
can be created and saved. Each saved View Pane is listed under the
“\ *View*\ ” menu and can be retrieved for viewing or permanently
deleted using this menu.

Import: 
	Imports a **MINEDW** project, *a* *FEFLOW* data set or a
	stereolithography file containing a finite-element mesh. After the
	“\ *Import*\ ” button is clicked, an “\ *Import File*\ ” dialog box
	opens and provides four options. A user can import a **MINEDW**
	data-file list (.FEL) that was created for **MINEDW** model
	simulations, a **MINEDW** geometry file (.PST) that was created with
	the mesh generator from **MINEDW** **2.10**, a geometry file (.STL)
	that was created using *Rhinoceros 3D*, a *FEFLOW* ASCII data file
	(.FEM), or a *FEFLOW* ASCII result file (.DAC). If a **MINEDW**
	data-set file (.FEL) is used, then all information related to the
	model—except the results—is imported; however, if a **MINEDW**
	geometry file (.PST) is used, then only the geometry and the geologic
	zone information are imported. Importing model data sets is discussed in
	detail in Chapter 4.

Export: 
	Exports the model in a *FEFLOW*-supported format that can be

3.4 Control Panel Pane
----------------------

The Control Panel displays a plot file created through “\ *Create New
Plot*.” Each of the plot files is listed under the View Pane. A specific
plot file will display in the Control Panel after it is selected.

The attributes of the selected plot are displayed in three sub-panes of
the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane: 1) “\ *Plot Items*,” 2) “\ *View*,” and
3) “\ *Information*\ ” (as shown in Figure 3.1). The “\ *Plot Item*\ ”
sub-pane is used to build plots by adding items to the view and
specifying their appearance using the available options. The
“\ *View*\ ” sub-pane provides tools for manipulating the view (e.g.,
rotation, magnification, and position). The “\ *Information*\ ” sub-pane
displays information (e.g., location and ID) pertaining to items in the
current plot when the cursor is positioned over a specific item in the
view. The “\ *Plot Items*\ ” and “\ *View*\ ” sub-panes are each divided
into two sections that can be independently minimized. Each sub-pane set
can be displayed or hidden using the control buttons on the
`toolbar <mk:@MSITStore:C:\Program%20Files\Itasca\Flac3d400\flac3d400help.chm::/toolbar.html>`__
(shown in Figure 3.21).

3.4.1 Plot Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each plot file may consist of several plot items. In **MINEDW,** plot
items are 2-D or 3-D representations of node or element properties and
model output such as particle tracks and open-pit seepage. As shown in
Figure 3.22 (the **MINEDW** interface), the “\ *Plot Items*\ ”
sub-pane contains two sections. The upper section shows the list of plot
items, and the lower section offers the option of displaying the
attributes (“*Attributes*\ ”) or selecting other plot items to be
displayed (“*List*\ ”). When a plot item is highlighted, the attributes
associated with that item become active. The plot item can be activated
(made visible) or deactivated (made invisible) by clicking the ellipse
icon to the left of the plot item. Additionally, right-clicking on a
plot item brings up a menu that allows the user to activate, deactivate,
or delete a plot item from a plot file.

	</div>

The “\ *Plot Items*\ ” sub-pane contains three groups, differentiated by
color as shown in Figure 3.23. The first group, which is in blue,
contains three special plot items, 1) “\ *Legend*,” 2) “\ *Display
Settings*,” and 3) “\ *Global Settings.*\ ” These three plot items are
included for all plots. The second group, which is in black, consists of
1) “\ *Axes*,” 2) “\ *Observation*,” 3) “\ *Boundary Conditions*,” 4)
“\ *Element*,” 5) “\ *File Data*,” 6) “\ *Node*,” and 7) “\ *Post
Processing.*\ ” Each item in the second group can be added to a plot.
The third group of plot items, which is in green, contains “\ *Cutting
Planes*\ ” and “\ *Clip Box.*\ ” The plot items in the third group can
be added to a plot to create different cross-section views through the
model domain.

3.4.1.1 Legend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

“\ *Legend*\ ” is a local copy of the legend’s settings that are in
effect for the current plot. The legend is displayed on the Legend Pane.
On top of the Legend Pane is the ***MINEDW*** version and time stamp
when the plot was created. There are two alternatives for setting the
legend:

- Alternative 1 is to set legend attributes before the creation of a
  plot file. Legend attributes of this alternative are set through
  the “\ *Options*\ ” dialog box under the “\ *Tools*\ ” menu on
  the Main Menu banner. The attributes from Alternative 1 will
  apply to all new plot files.

- Alternative 2 is to set the legend attributes for the currently
  displayed plot file in the Control Panel Pane. Legend attributes
  from this alternative only apply to the currently selected plot
  file and will not affect other plot files or new plot files that
  will be created.

The attributes associated with legends are described below:

Placement: 
	Sets the position of the Legend Panel to one of three
	preset options: 1) “\ *Left”* (side of View Pane), 2) “\ *Right”* (side
	of View Pane), or 3) “\ *Floating*\ ” (inside the View Pane).

Width: 
	Sets the width of the legend as a percentage of the View Pane
	containing the plot. The minimum value of width is 25. The width can be
	increased for all three placement options of the Legend Panel.

Height: 
	Sets the height of the Legend Panel as a percentage of the
	View Pane containing the plot. This setting is only applicable if the
	“\ *Placement*\ ” attribute is set to “\ *Floating*.”

Position: 
	Specifies the left-side position and bottom position of the
	plot item as a percentage of the available rendering area. It uses a
	scale of 0 to 100, in which 0 indicates the bottom-left corner and 100
	indicates the top-right corner. Continuous adjustment of the upward
	vertical position once the top of the Legend Panel reaches the top of
	View Pane will reduce the height of the Legend Panel. The
	“\ *Position*\ ” setting is only applicable if the legend
	“\ *Placement*\ ” attribute is set to “\ *Floating*.”

Outline: 
	Sets the visibility, color, and thickness of the plot item’s
	outline.

Heading: 
	Sets the color of the legend heading.

Copyright: 
	Sets the color of the copyright notice in the legend.

View Info: 
	Sets the visibility of the current view orientation report
	in the legend. The report can include the following items—each of which
	can be selected individually for inclusion in the view info in the
	legend—“\ *Center*,” “\ *Eye*,” “\ *Dip/DD/Roll*,” “\ *Normal*,”
	“\ *Radius*,” and “\ *Projection*.” Sub-controls for each of the items
	are provided for specifying the size, font, style, and color of the text
	used.

Step: 
	This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

Time: 
	Sets the visibility of the time in the legend. The time used is
	that at which the view was last modified. The sub-controls provided can
	specify the size, font, style, and color of the text used to display the
	time in the legend.

Customer Title: 
	This option is not active in **MINEDW**.

On the *“Attributes”* tab for the *“Legend”* item, the legend settings
for each of the plot items that the user has added to the current plot
are also listed beneath the “\ *Customer Title”* attribute. The controls
provided can add or remove the plot item from the legend and specify the
size, font, style, and color of the text. In the case of plot items that
have multiple sub-parts, such as contours or units, the user can add or
remove the individual sub-labels from the legend.

3.4.1.2 Display Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

“\ *Display Settings*\ ” is a local copy of the display settings that
are in effect for the plot items currently selected. There are two
alternatives for setting display:

-  Alternative 1 is to set display attributes before the creation of a
   plot file. Display attributes of this alternative are set through the
   “\ *Options*\ ” dialog box under the “\ *Tools*\ ” menu on the Main
   Menu banner. The attributes from Alternative 1 will apply to all new
   plot files.

-  Alternative 2 is to set the display attributes for the currently
   displayed plot file in the Control Panel Pane. Display attributes
   from this alternative only apply to the currently selected plot file
   and will not affect other plot files or new plot files that will be
   created.

The attributes available under “\ *Display Settings*\ ” and their
descriptions are presented below:

Name: 
	Indicates the name of the active view. For all views except the
	Base View, this control can be used to name or rename the current view.

Active: 
	Controls whether the view is active or inactive.

Auto Update: 
	Sets the option of whether to auto-update the view while
	cycling (this is enabled via a checkbox). The interval for updating is
	found under the “\ *Global Settings*\ ” plot item because the interval
	is the same for all auto-updating views.

Background: 
	Sets the background color of the view.

Outline: 
	Sets the visibility, color, and thickness of the item’s outline.

Job Title: 
	This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

View Title: 
	Sets the visibility of the title. The sub-controls
	provided can specify the size, font, style, color, and title displayed
	in the plot.

Target: 
	This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

Movie: 
	This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

3.4.1.3 Global Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

“\ *Global Settings*\ ” is a local copy of the global settings that are
in effect for the current plot. The options can be set in the “\ *Plot
Items*\ ” sub-pane or via the “\ `Options\ ”
dialog <mk:@MSITStore:C:\Program%20Files\Itasca\Flac3d400\flac3d400help.chm::/options.html>`__
box found under the “\ *Tools*\ ” menu on the Main Menu banner. Changing
the settings on the current plot also sets them in the “\ *Options*\ ”
dialog box and subsequently affects all plot files because these changes
are applied globally. The attributes available under “\ *Global
Settings*\ ” and their descriptions are listed below.

Vertex Arrays: 
	Specifies whether vertex arrays are used to draw
	objects in Open Graphics Library. The default setting is “on.” When
	using older OpenGL display drivers, disabling this attribute can improve
	images sometimes. Note that disabling this attribute implies that the
	vertex buffer objects are also turned off.

Vertex Buffer Objects: 
	Determines whether the vertex buffer object
	OpenGL extension is used (if available). The default setting is “on.”
	Note that disabling this attribute can improve images when using display
	drivers that presently report this extension but do not properly support
	it.

Interactive1: 
	This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

Interactive2: 
	This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

Picking: 
	This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

Sketch Mode: 
	Renders the item using a reduced (rather than full)
	rendering method, which can accelerate response in certain rendering
	situations (e.g., model rotation).

Update Interval: 
	This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

Print Size: 
	Sets the width and height of the output sent to a printer
	or to a bitmap file.

DXF Warning: 
	Option to display the warning about styling when a .DXF
	file is exported.

VRML Warning: 
	Option to display the warning about styling when a .VRML
	file is exported.

Movie: 
	This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

The second group in the “\ *Plot Items*\ ” sub-pane consists of
“\ *Axes*,” “\ *Observation*,” “\ *Boundary* *Conditions*,”
“\ *Element*,” “\ *File* *Data*,” “\ *Node*,” and “\ *Post*
*Processing*\ ” (shown in **MINEDW** and Figure 3.23 in black), which
can be added to the plot items. These are discussed in more detail in
the following sections.

3.4.1.4 Axes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The “\ *Axes*\ ” plot item is an interactive orientation indicator that
can be displayed as *x*-, *y*-, and *z*-axes or as compass points
(easting and northing). The attributes available for axes and their
descriptions are given below.

AutoConf: 
	Sets the axes display as either *x*-, *y*-, and *z*-axes or
	as compass points (easting and northing) by clicking the icons shown.

X-Axis: 
	The *x*-axis display with sub-controls for specifying color,
	draw (in positive, negative, or both directions), “+” label, and “-”
	label (the axis label in positive and negative directions).

Y-Axis: 
	The *y*-axis display with sub-controls for specifying color,
	draw (in positive, negative, or both directions), “+” label, and “-”
	label (the axis label in positive and negative directions).

Z-Axis: 
	The *z*-axis display with sub-controls for specifying color,
	draw (in positive, negative, or both directions), “+” label, and “-”
	label (the axis label in positive and negative directions).

Fixed: 
	When enabled, this control fixes the axes to a location on the
	screen. Use the “Screen” attribute to specify the position. When
	disabled, this control positions the axes in model space.

Scale: 
	Specifies a size in percentage units when the axes are fixed.

Screen: 
	Specifies the *x* and *y* position of the axis center in
  	percentage units (0, 0 = bottom left; 100, 100 = top right) when the axes are fixed.

Size: 
	Specifies the axes size in model units when the axes are not fixed.

Position: 
	Places the origin of the axis at the *x*-, *y*-, and
	*z*-position (in model units) specified when the axes are not fixed.

Font: 
	Specifies the font, size, and style (e.g., normal, bold, italic)
	used by the plot item.

Transparency: 
	Specifies the plot item’s transparency (70–100). When
	transparency is toggled off, the point and its label are displayed in
	opaque state.

Caption: 
	When enabled, this control shows the plot item (labeled,
	described, and enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The
	sub-attributes provided are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and
	its display requirements in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have
	a “\ *Title*\ ” sub-attribute.

3.4.1.5 Observation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The “\ *Observation*\ ” plot item includes the display settings for
observation wells such as stand pipe with screen (Borehole in
Observation) and grouted-in vibrating piezometers (Piezo in
Observation). For Piezo, the location of the transducer can also be
displayed (Transducer in Observation). The display attributes available
for observation wells and their descriptions are given below.

Map: 
	This attribute positions, scales, and orients the plot item via
	the sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
	coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
	*z*\ ” (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z*
	coordinates are to be swapped); 2) translate (or offset), which
	specifies values for *x*, *y*, and *z* plot-item position offsets; and
	3) scale, which multiplies the coordinate system by the specified value.
	These attributes are generally not required to change if the coordinates
	of the observation points are the same as other plot items of the plot
	file.

Colors: 
	Specifies the number of colors to use on the plot. Includes
	sub-attributes that enumerate the indexed items to enable specification
	of color by item. Observation wells are colored by borehole, piezometer,
	and transducer.

Line: 
	Sets the thickness and style of the line(s) used to represent the
	screen interval of the observation well or piezometer.

Scale: 
	Specifies a size in percentage units when the axes are fixed.

Text: 
	Displays the labels of the observation wells. By toggling the
	arrow, the label can be displayed or hidden.

Transparency: 
	Specifies the plot item’s transparency (70–100). When
	transparency is toggled off, the point and its label are displayed in
	opaque state.

Caption: 
	When this control is selected, the plot item is shown
	(labeled, described, and enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The
	sub-attributes provided are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and
	its display requirements in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have
	“\ *Title*\ ” or *“Line”* and “\ *Color”* sub-attributes. In the case
	where the Legend Pane is occupied by the legend of other plot items
	(such as hydrogeologic units), the user can disable the display of
	selected plot items (such as “\ *Element*\ ” or “\ *Node*\ ”) to see the
	caption attributes of the “\ *Observation*\ ” plot item.

Toggle Well: 
	Provides a list of each observation well that is included
	in the plot. Individual observation wells can be removed from the View
	Pane. This function allows the user to include some or all observation
	wells when exporting a .DXF file from **MINEDW**.

Section Distance: 
	This feature is used in conjunction with a
	cross-section view. It allows the user to specify which observation
	locations to display by using a distance. For example, if a user creates
	a cross section and wishes to display observation locations within 100
	meters of the cross-section plane, they would enter “100” in the box
	next to the attribute label if the coordinate system used in the model
	is in meters.

3.4.1.6 Boundary Conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The “\ *Boundary Conditions*\ ” plot item includes the display settings
for boundary conditions. The boundary conditions include “\ *Constant
Head & Drain*,” “\ *Pumping Well*,” “\ *River*,” and “\ *Variable
Flux*.” The display attributes available for boundary conditions and
their descriptions are given below. Detailed information about the
boundary conditions can be found in Section 7.4.

**Constant Head & Drain**

Map: 
	This attribute positions, scales, and orients the plot item via
	the sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
	coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
	*z”* (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z* coordinates
	are to be swapped); 2) translate (or offset), which specifies values for
	*x*, *y*, and *z* plot-item position offsets; and 3) scale, which
	multiplies the coordinate system by the specified value. These
	attributes are generally not required to change if the coordinates of
	the constant head or drain are the same as other plot items of the plot
	file.

Scale: 
	Specifies the size of the plot item.

Groups: 
	Constant-head boundary nodes can be grouped to represent a
	specified hydrogeologic component, such as a surface-water body, an
	underground drift, or a pumping well. Each group of constant-head nodes
	can be presented in a different color in **MINEDW**.

Text: 
	This attribute sets the font style, text size, and text style of
	the labels of the boundary conditions displayed in the View Pane.

Transparency: 
	Specifies the plot item’s transparency (70–100). The
	minimum value for transparency setting is 70. When the transparency is
	toggled off, the plot item is displayed in opaque state.

Caption: 
	When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
	enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
	are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
	in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have “\ *Title*\ ” or *“Line”*
	and “\ *Color”* sub-attributes. In the case where the Legend Pane is
	occupied by the legend of other plot items (such as hydrogeologic
	units), the user can disable the display of selected plot items (such as
	“\ *Element*\ ” or “\ *Node*\ ”) to see the caption attributes of the
	“\ *Boundary Conditions*\ ” plot item.

Maximum Flux: 
	By specifying a value, the user can specify the upper
	limit of flux values to display. Flux values larger than the specified
	value will not be displayed.

Excluded Flux: 
	By specifying a value, the user can exclude certain
	flux values from display.

Dynamic: 
	This option only applies to “\ *Constant Head & Drain*\ ”
	boundary conditions and is used to visualize boundary conditions that
	become active/inactive at different times through the model simulation.

**Pumping Well**

There are three types of pumping wells in **MINEDW**:

1. Rate: The well is simulated with the assigned pumping rate.

2. Head: The well is simulated as a specified head and the pumping rate
   is derived from the model simulation.

3. LPE: The well is simulated with the assigned lowest pumping elevation
   (LPE). If the simulated water level of the well reaches the LPE, the
   active pumping will be switched to passive draining to prevent the
   drying up of the well and pump.

Map: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain.*\ ”

Color: 
	Each type of pumping well is presented in a different color.
	Deselecting a specific type will remove that type of well from the View
	Pane and Legend Pane.

Line: 
	Sets the thickness and style of the lines used to represent the well depth.

Scale: 
	When the “\ *Scale*\ ” box is checked, increasing the scale
	value will increase the size of the dot of each well. Unchecking the
	“\ *Scale*\ ” box will display the default size of the dot.

Text: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain*.”

Transparency: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain*.”

Caption: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain*.”

Toggle Well: 
	This feature is used to toggle the display of each well.

Section Distance: 
	This feature is used in conjunction with a
	cross-section view and only applies to the “\ *Pumping Well”* plot item.
	It allows the user to specify which pumping well to display by using a
	distance in model units. For example, if a user creates a cross section
	and wishes to display pumping wells within 100 meters of the
	cross-section plane, they would enter “\ *100*\ ” in the box next to the
	attribute label.

**Variable Flux**

Map: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain.”*

Scale: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain.”*

Transparency: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain.”*

Caption: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain.”*

Flux View: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain.”*

File: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain.”*

Minimum Flux: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain.”*

Maximum Flux: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain.”*

Excluded Flux: 
	Same as in “\ *Constant Head & Drain.”*

3.4.1.7 Element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The “\ *Element*\ ” plot items include 2-D and 3-D plot items that can
be used to display hydrogeologic properties of elements. These
properties include geologic zones, recharge, evaporation, hydraulic
properties, and time-varied conductivity. “\ *Element*\ ” plot items
also include the “\ *Pinch-Out*\ ” plot item, which can be used to view
and assign pinch-outs in the model.

2D Plane: 
	Displays element information for the geologic zone
	(“*Zone*\ ”), recharge (“*Recharge*\ ”), or evaporation
	(“*Evaporation*\ ”) in 2-D plane view.

3D Element: 
	Displays element information for the hydrogeologic zone in 3-D.

Pinch-Out: 
	Allows the user to create areas of refined vertical
	discretization and display these areas.

Properties: 
	Displays hydraulic properties (*K\ :sub:`x`*,
	*K\ :sub:`y`*, *K\ :sub:`z`*, *S\ :sub:`y`*, and *S\ :sub:`s`*) in 3-D.

Time-Varied Conductivity: 
	Displays the ZOR created for an open pit or
	cave zone for underground mining in the “\ *Mining*\ ” menu.

The attributes related to these plot items are described below.

**2D Plane**

Color By: 
	Specifies which attribute is used for the plot. The
	attributes include “\ *Zone*,” “\ *Recharge*,” and “\ *Evaporation*.”

Layer: 
	Indicates which layer of the model to display on the plot.

Map: 
	This attribute positions, scales, and orients the plot item via
	the sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
	coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
	*z”* (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z* coordinates
	are to be swapped); 2) offset (or translate), which specifies values for
	*x*, *y*, and *z* plot-item position offsets; and 3) scale, which
	multiplies the coordinate system by the specified value.

Colors: 
	Allows the user to specify the colors to be used in the plot.
	This attribute also allows the user to select which items they wish to
	display in the plot by activating the checkbox next to the item.

Fill: 
	Specifies whether polygons rendered by a plot item should be filled.

Wireframe: 
	Specifies whether the plot item should be displayed with a
	wireframe and determines the color and the line thickness of the
	displayed wireframe.

Wire Trans: 
	Not active.

Cull Backface: 
	Specifies whether backface culling is enabled. When set
	to “\ *On*,” the backfaces of polygons are not rendered (it is often
	necessary to disable this function to see the far side of some cut-plane
	plots).

Lighting: 
	Option to turn lighting on or off. Lighting provides depth
	to the plot item because it creates natural shadows.

Offset: 
	Specifies settings for the OpenGL polygon offset. If the
	polygons are rendered poorly, then setting these values close to zero
	might improve performance. The first value specifies a scale factor to
	create a variable-depth offset for each polygon; the second value
	creates a constant-depth offset.

Cutline: 
	Specifies the line thickness of lines plotted on a cutting
	plane, with a range of 1 to 10.

Cutplane: 
	This option is only active when a cutplane plot item is
	added to the plot view. The options for “\ *Cutplane*\ ” are “\ *On,*\ ”
	“\ *Front,*\ ” and “\ *Back,*\ ” which turn on the cutplane, make the
	model domain on the front of the cutplane visible, and make the model
	domain on the back of the cutplane visible, respectively. In order to
	show the entire plane, the “\ *Cull Backface*\ ” option should be
	unchecked.

Clip Box: 
	Specifies which of the clip box items available in the
	current view to apply to the current plot item. This option is only
	active when a clip box plot item is added to the plot view.

Transparency: 
	Specifies the plot item’s transparency (70–100). When
	unchecked, the plot item is displayed in opaque state.

Caption: 
	When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
	enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
	are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
	in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have “\ *Title*\ ” or
	“\ *Colors*\ ” and “\ *Label*\ ” sub-attributes.

	the criteria selected by the user and assigns them to the selected group
	(options are “\ *To Zone,*\ ” “\ *Select With*,” “\ *Element Selected
	When Including,*\ ” and “\ *Layer Thickness*\ ”).

To Data File: 
	Saves the .DXF file to a text file format that can be
	used for creating an open-pit mine plan.

**ESRI Shapefile (SHP)**

This plot item is used to import a shapefile (.SHP), a common
\ *ArcGIS*\ :sup:`©` file format, to the current view. A shapefile is a
popular geospatial vector data format for geographic information systems	
software. Shapefiles spatially describe geometries—points, polylines,
and polygons. A shapefile is actually a group of several files, three of
which are required to form a valid set. A valid shapefile set contains
at least a main file (.SHP), a dBASE file (.DBF), and an index file
(.SHX). The main file contains spatial information about features (e.g.,
coordinates along a line or polygon), the dBASE file contains a table of
attributes related to those spatial features (e.g., the name of a
feature or some measurement taken at a feature), and the index file
indexes the byte-location of features within a .SHP file. The attributes
available for this option and their descriptions are provided below.

File: 
	Use the plus sign (+) available for this attribute to display
	the “\ *Select SHP file*\ ” dialog box to select which .SHP files to
	load. Once loaded, the file name is shown in this attribute.

Attribute Table: 
	Displays the contents of the dBASE file. A dBASE file
	contains a table of attributes associated with the features defined in a
	shapefile.

Coordinate Info: 
	Displays the contents of a .PRJ file (a .PRJ
	shapefile is not related to the .PRJ file created by ***MINEDW***). A
	.PRJ file contains information about the coordinate system and
	projection in which the shapefile features are defined. A .PRJ file may
	or may not be present.

Group by:*
	Specifies an attribute of the dBASE file with which to group
	features. Each group is given a unique color and label in the legend and
	view. To display all features as separate entities, select the last item
	(Record ID) from the drop-down menu.

Label by: 
	Specifies an attribute of the dBASE file by which to label
	features within the view. Because an apparently single feature may be
	defined in a shapefile as several features (e.g., a line composed of
	line segments), duplicate labels may appear.

Project to Surface: 
	Projects the .SHP file to the ground surface.

Symbol:
	Specifies the symbol to represent the data.

Scale:
	Specifies the size of the symbol.

Colors:
	Specifies the colors of features in the shapefile.

Line: 
	Specifies line thickness of the data.

Map: 
	This control positions, scales, and orients the plot item via the
	sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
	coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
	*z*\ ” (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z*
	coordinates are to be swapped); 2) offset (or translate), which
	specifies values for *x*, *y*, and *z* plot-item position offsets; and
	3) scale, which multiplies the coordinate system by the specified value.

Text: 
	Specifies the font used for labels.

Transparency: 
	Specifies the plot item’s transparency (70–100). The
	lowest value for transparency is 70. When unchecked, the plot item is
	displayed in opaque state.

Caption: 
	When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
	enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
	are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
	in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have “\ *Title*\ ” or
	“\ *Colors*\ ” and “\ *Label*\ ” sub-attributes.

**Point Data**

This plot item is used to display x, y, and z data as points. The
attributes available for this option and their descriptions are given
below.

File: 
	Use the plus sign (+) available for this attribute to display
	the “\ *Select Data File*\ ” dialog box to select which .DAT files to
	load. Once loaded, the file name is shown in this attribute.

Project to Surface: 
	Projects the .DAT file to the ground surface.

Text: 
	Specifies the font used for labels.

Map: 
	This control positions, scales, and orients the plot item via the
	sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
	coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
	*z*\ ” (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z*
	coordinates are to be swapped); 2) offset (or translate), which
	specifies values for *x*, *y*, and *z* plot-item position offsets; and
	3) scale, which multiplies the coordinate system by the specified value.

Scale: 
	Specifies the size of the symbol.

Colors: 
	Specifies the color of the points.

Transparency: 
	Specifies the plot item’s transparency (0 = solid, 100 = invisible).

Caption: 
	When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
	enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
	are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
	in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have “\ *Title*\ ” or
	“\ *Colors*\ ” and “\ *Label*\ ” sub-attributes.

3.4.1.9 Node
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The “\ *Node*\ ” plot item includes 2-D and 3-D plots that are related
to properties of finite-element nodes. These properties include nodal
elevation, groundwater head, pore pressure, drawdown at a given time,
and head difference for two different dates in both 2-D and 3-D.

2D Contour: 
	Displays groundwater head, pressure, elevation, head
	difference, water table, and drawdown in 2-D.

3D Contour: 
	Displays groundwater head, pressure, elevation, and head
	difference in 3-D.

Isoline: 
	Displays isolines for elevation, pore pressure, head, head
	difference, water table, and drawdown.

IsoSurface: 
	Displays isosurfaces for elevation, head, pore pressure,
	and head difference.

The attributes related to these four plot items are described below.

**2D Contour and 3D Contour**

Color By: 
	Specifies which attribute is used for the plot.

Layer: 
	Specifies which layer of the model is displayed on the plot.

Map: 
	This attribute positions, scales, and orients the plot item via
	the sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
	coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
	*z*\ ” (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z*
	coordinates are to be swapped); 2) offset (or translate), which
	specifies values for *x*, y, and *z* plot-item position offsets; and 3)
	scale, which multiplies the coordinate system by the specified value.

Contour: 
	Provides sub-attributes for controlling contour display.
	These are 1) “Ramp,” which defines the color ramp to use (grayscale,
	rainbow, etc.); 2) “\ *Maximum*,” which specifies (or automatically
	calculates) the maximum value (right-hand end of the ramp); 3)
	“\ *Minimum*,” which specifies (or automatically calculates) the minimum
	value (left-hand end of the ramp); 4) “\ *Interval*,” which specifies
	(or automatically calculates) the interval between colors on the ramp;
	5) “\ *Reversed*,” which inverts the display of the maximum and minimum
	values relative to the ramp; 6) “\ *Below*,” which specifies (or
	automatically selects) the color to use for displaying values that are
	less than those specified by “\ *Minimum*\ ”; and 7) “\ *Above*,” which
	specifies (or automatically selects) the color to use for displaying
	values that are greater than those specified by “\ *Maximum*.”

Fill: 
	Specifies whether polygons rendered by a plot item should be filled.

Line: 
	Sets the thickness and color of the lines used to represent the
	plot item. The attribute is only available for the *Isoline* plot item.

Wireframe: 
	Specifies whether the plot item should display with a
	finite-element mesh wireframe as well as the color and the line
	thickness of the wireframe.

Wire Trans: 
	Specifies the wireframe’s transparency (0 = solid, 100 = invisible).

Cull Backface: 
	Specifies whether backface culling is enabled. When
	this setting is enabled, the backfaces of polygons are not rendered (it
	often is necessary to turn off this feature to see the far side of some
	cutplane plots).

Lighting: 
	Enables the lighting.

Offset: 
	Specifies settings for the OpenGL polygon offset. If the
	polygons are rendered poorly, then setting these values close to zero
	might improve performance. The first value is a factor that specifies a
	scale factor to create a variable-depth offset for each polygon; the
	second value is used to create a constant-depth offset.

Cutline: 
	Specifies the line thickness of lines plotted on a cutting plane.

Cutplane: 
	Option for displaying the model domain in front of or behind
	(or both) a cross-section plane. This option is useful when orienting
	the cross-section plane.

Clip Box: 
	Specifies which of the clip box items available in the
	current view to apply to the current plot item.

Transparency: 
	Specifies the plot item’s transparency (70–100). The
	lowest value for transparency is 70. When unchecked, the plot item is
	displayed in opaque state.

Caption: 
	When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
	enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
	are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
	in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have “\ *Title*\ ” or
	“\ *Colors*\ ” and “\ *Label*\ ” sub-attributes.

**Isoline**

The attributes of “\ *Isoline*\ ” are the same as those described in the
“\ *2D Contour/3D Contour*\ ” section with the exception of following:

Cutplane: 
	Though a cutplane is not very meaningful for “\ *Isoline*,”
	a user can generate a plane through the “\ *Cutplane*\ ” option from
	“\ *List*.”

Clip Box: 
	This operation is functional but does not provide meaningful
	display.

**Isosurface**

The attributes of “\ *Isosurface*\ ” are the same as those described in
the “\ *2D Contour/3D Contour*\ ” section with the exception of
“\ *Cutplane*.” A cutplane can only be created through the “\ *Plane*\ ”
option under “\ *Cutting Planes*\ ” in “\ *List*.”

3.4.1.10 Post Processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Particle Tracking: 
	Displays particle-tracking results (Section 9.4).

Pit Flux: 
	This option can be used to display the seepage that occurs
	at the pit wall, which is recorded by **MINEDW** during the model
	simulation in the file with a .SEP extension (Section 9.6).

**Particle Tracking**

To operate the attributes related to particle tracking, a
particle-tracking result should be inputted as a **MINEDW** plot item.
The attributes related to the “\ *Particle Tracking*\ ” plot item are
described below.

File: 
	The icon next to the “\ *File”* attribute opens a dialog box
	that is used to import particle tracks.

Arrow Scale: 
	This attribute controls the size of the arrow displayed
	on the particle tracks that indicate direction. It does not apply to the
	last time step.

ColorByMag: 
	The magnitude of the velocity along the displayed particle
	tracks can be shown by using this attribute. This attribute allows the
	selection of a number of color ramps and allows the “\ *Maximum*,”
	“\ *Minimum,”* and “\ *Interval”* to be defined. It does not apply to
	the last time step.

Map: 
	This attribute positions, scales, and orients the plot item via
	the sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
	coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
	*z*\ ” (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z*
	coordinates are to be swapped); 2) offset (or translate), which
	specifies values for *x*, y, and *z* plot-item position offsets; and 3)
	scale, which multiplies the coordinate system by the specified value.

Colors: 
	This attribute can be used to control the display color of particle tracks.

Line: 
	Sets the thickness and style of the lines used to represent the
	“\ *Particle Tracking”* plot item.

Transparency: 
	Specifies the plot item’s transparency (0 = solid, 100 = invisible).

Caption: 
	When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
	enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
	are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
	in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have “\ *Title*\ ” or
	“\ *Colors*\ ” and “\ *Label*\ ” sub-attributes.

Scale: 
	Controls the size of the displayed seepage point.

Colors: 
	This attribute can be used to control the display color of seepage points.

Transparency: 
	The same as in “\ *Particle Tracking*.”

Caption: 
	The same as in “\ *Particle Tracking*.”

Flux View: 
	This option enables the display of flux values from the
	“\ *Pit Flux*\ ” boundary conditions using both color and marker size to
	represent the relative magnitudes of flux.

File: 
	The icon next to the “\ *File”* attribute opens a dialog box
	that is used to import a pit-flux file.

Minimum Flux: 
	Sets the minimum absolute flux value to display using
	the “\ *Pit Flux*\ ” boundary condition.

Maximum Flux: 
	Sets the maximum absolute flux value to display using
	the “\ *Pit Flux*\ ” boundary condition.

Excluded Flux: 
	Option to enable the display of flux values outside of
	the specified minimum and maximum flux values.

3.4.1.11 Cutting Planes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The third “\ *Plot Items*\ ” group consists of “\ *Cutting Planes*\ ”
and “\ *Clip Box*.” “\ *Cutting Planes,*\ ” contains “\ *Plane,”
“Wedge,”* and *“Octant.”* Both “\ *Cutting Planes*\ ” and “\ *Clip
Box*\ ” are displayed in green in **MINEDW**. These items are similar
to plot items (and are handled as plot items) in that they are
independent objects appearing in the plot. They are distinct from plot
items in that they are applied to one or more plot items for the purpose
of visualization and, as such, are dependent on plot items. For example,
a cutplane can be defined as part of a plot, but until it is applied to
at least one plot item, its rendering is incomplete and is not visible
in the View Pane.

The “\ *Cutting Planes*\ ” group contains three items: 1) “\ *Plane*,”
2) “\ *Wedge*,” and 3) “\ *Octant*.” The function of each item is
described below:

Plane: 
	The plane can be applied to plot items to “slice” them into
	2-D. A plane is manipulated using its “\ *Origin*,” which can be
	repositioned to move the cutplane, and the visible surface of the plane
	itself can be rotated in the View Pane to view different aspects of the
	plane.

Wedge: 
	The wedge cutplane can be applied to plot items to “slice” the
	model into a wedge shape that is defined by two planes joined along an
	origin. The plane is manipulated using its “\ *Origin*,” which can be
	changed to reposition the location of the cutplane.

Octant: 
	The octant cutplane provides a cubical cutplane that can be
	applied to plot items to “slice” them in three orthogonal directions
	simultaneously. The plane is manipulated using its “\ *Origin*,” which
	can be repositioned. The visible surface of the plane itself can be
	dragged to rotate the plane three-dimensionally.

The attributes available for cutting planes and their descriptions are
given below.

**Plane**

Name: 
	Sets or indicates the name of the cutplane. This name is used to
	label the cutplane as it is listed in the “\ *Plot Items*\ ” list, on
	the “\ *Cutplane*\ ” selector in the attribute list for all plot items
	(under the “\ *Cutplane*\ ” attribute), and in the legend (if its
	“\ *Caption*\ ” attribute is enabled).

Origin: 
	The origin of the plane.

Normal (1, 2, 3): 
	Defines the orientation of the indicated cutplane via a normal vector.

Dip/DD (1, 2, 3): 
	Sets the dip and dip direction, respectively, of the
	selected plane. There are two of these controls on a wedge and three on
	an octant; they are labeled with numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3).

Snap View: 
	Snaps the view to a perpendicular orientation so that the
	user sees the side of the plane. One click will display normal
	orientation; the second click will display the view in reverse
	orientation.

Move Normal: 
	Moves the cutting plane along the normal direction. The
	user can enter the interval of each move or use the default value.

Target: 
	This attribute is not used in “\ *Move Normal*.”

Caption: 
	When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
	enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
	are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
	in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have “\ *Title*\ ” or *“Line”*
	and “\ *Color”* sub-attributes.

**Wedge**

Name: 
	Same as in “\ *Plane*.”

Origin: 
	The origin of the wedge plane.

Normal 1: 
	Defines the orientation of one side of the wedge plane via a normal vector.

Dip 1/DD 1: 
	Sets the dip and dip direction of one side of the wedge plane.

Snap View: 
	Same as in “\ *Plane*\ ” for one plane of the wedge.

Normal 2: 
	Defines the orientation of the other side of the wedge plane via a normal vector.

Dip 2/DD 2: 
	Sets the dip and dip direction of the other side of the wedge plane.

Snap View: 
	Same as in “\ *Plane*\ ” for the other plane of the wedge.

Wedge Angle: 
	Sets the angle of the wedge cutting plane.

Caption: 
	Same as in “\ *Plane*.”

**Octant**

The attributes of “\ *Octant*\ ” are the same as in “\ *Wedge*\ ” with
the following exceptions:

1. There are three attributes of “\ *Normal*,” “\ *Dip/DD*,” and
   “\ *Snap View*.”

2. There is no “\ *Wedge Angle*.”

3.4.1.12 Clip Box
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When applied to a plot item, the “\ *Clip Box*\ ” control constrains the
display of the plot item according to its size, position, and
orientation. It is similar to a cutplane in that it is applied to plot
items and, although a view can have multiple clip boxes in it, only one
clip box can be applied to a given plot item at a time. Both a cutplane
and clip box can be applied to a plot item simultaneously. The
attributes available for the “\ *Clip Box*\ ” controls and their
descriptions are given below.

Name: 
	Sets or indicates the name of the clip box. This name is used to
	label the clip box as it is listed in the “\ *Plot Items*\ ” list, on
	the “\ *Clip Box*\ ” selector in the attribute list for all plot items
	(under the “\ *Clip Box*\ ” attribute), and in the legend if its
	“\ *Caption*\ ” attribute is enabled.

Center: 
	Sets the position of the plot item’s center in model units.

Dip: 
	Sets the dip of the clip box.

Dip Dir: 
	Sets the dip direction of the clip box.

Clip Axis (1, 2, 3): 
	Activates a specified axis that will determine
	the direction of clipping. If “\ *Clip Axis 1*\ ” is selected, clipping
	only occurs along the x direction.

Axis Radii: 
	Specifies the radius of clip axis 1, clip axis 2, and clip
	axis 3, respectively, away from the current center.

Axis Offsets: 
	Specifies the offset from the center of each of the
	three axes.

Interactive: 
	This option is not active in **MINEDW**.

Caption: 
	When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
	enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
	are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
	in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have a “\ *Title*\ ” sub-attribute.

3.4.2 View
~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *View*\ ” sub-pane of the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane (Figure
3.24) is discussed in this section. As shown in Figure 3.24, the
“\ *View*\ ” sub-pane is divided into two sections that can be minimized
independently and provides tools for manipulating (i.e., rotating,
magnifying, positioning) the view. The functions available in the
“\ *View*\ ” sub-pane are shown in Figure 3.24 and are described below.

   Figure 3.24 A “\ *View*\ ” pane and sub-panes

3D Rotate: 
	Use the roller tool to rotate the view in 3-D.

Reset View: 
	Re-centers the model in the View Pane and zooms to the model extent.

Slide Vertical Translation: 
	Change the vertical translation by dragging the slider in the desired direction.

Slide Rotation: 
	Change the rotation by dragging the slider in the desired direction; 
	rotation is normal (perpendicular) to the screen.

Slide Horizontal Translation: 
	Change the horizontal translation by dragging the slider in the desired direction.

Slide Magnification: 
	Change the magnification level by dragging the slider in the desired direction.

Eye: 
	Reports the *x*, *y*, and *z* positions of the “\ *Eye*\ ” in
	model coordinates. Enter the desired values in the boxes and press the
	[Enter] key to “snap” the view as specified.

Center: 
	Reports the *x*, *y*, and *z* positions of the view center in
	model coordinates. Enter desired values in the boxes and press the
	[Enter] key to snap the view as specified.

Rotation: 
	Reports the dip, dip direction, and roll of the current View
	Pane in model coordinates. Enter desired values in the boxes and press
	the [Enter] key to snap the view as specified.

Scale: 
	Describes the view’s radius (extent from view center to view
	edge), eye distance, and magnification (respectively, from left to
	right). Radius and magnification both affect the apparent magnification
	of the view; however, radius uses a fixed angle for model perspective;
	thereby, reducing the value makes the model appear closer, and
	increasing the value makes the model appear farther away. In both cases,
	the eye position is moved accordingly to satisfy the fixed angle of the
	model perspective. Magnification increases or decreases the view without
	changing the eye position but correspondingly changes the radius value.
	The result is that increasing the value enlarges the model and reduces
	the radius value, and decreasing the value reduces the model and
	enlarges the radius value.

Mode: 
	This option can be used to choose the view mode, which changes
	the perspective of the View Pane.

Clip: 
	Clips the view shown in the View Pane.

3.4.3 Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *Information*\ ” control set provides information about the plot
item located at the current cursor position (Figure 3.25). For this
specific plot item, it shows the element ID, hydrogeologic zone
simulated in the model for this element, and the x, y, z values of the
cursor.
