7.0 Model Input Data
====================

This chapter describes generating inputs for a **MINEDW** model using
the user interface menus and tool buttons. **MINEDW** saves the model
files and results as a project file format (.PRJ) from which ASCII input
files can be generated for the calculation portion of the program. From
these files, users can easily restore a saved modeling project and
restart the model simulation from any selected time.

7.1 Project Definition
----------------------

The first step to create a new model is to define the project
properties. This section describes the project properties, including
simulation parameters, units, type of simulation, solver types, and file
output names.

7.1.1 Project Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project properties are defined by selecting “\ *Project Properties*\ ”
from the “\ *Project*\ ” drop-down menu on the Main Menu banner at the
top of the window. Select “\ *Project Properties,*\ ” and the
“\ *Project* *Properties*\ ” dialog box shown in Figure 7.1 appears. The
required information for project properties is described below.

.. figure:: media/figure_7_1_manual.png
   :width: 2.60453in
   :height: 3.86763in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.1 The “\ *Project Properties*\ ” dialog box

Project Name: 
	The user-defined name of the project.

Output File Name: 
	The prefix assigned to all ***MINEDW***-created
	data-set files (e.g., the model file would be labeled
	“\ *TR\_model.dat*\ ” when “\ *TR\_”* is the output file name)\ *.*

Unit: 
	Length units used in the model (meters and feet are the
	supported units in **MINEDW**).

Type of Simulation: 
	The means by which to select whether the model is
	a steady-state or transient-state simulation. In steady-state
	simulations, it is good practice to make sure that the storage changes
	are smaller than 1.0 x 10\ :sup:`-10` cubic meters per day
	(m:sup:`3`/day) at the end of the model simulation. This information can
	be found in the budget and output files (.BUD and .OUT) that are created
	in the simulation directory. For steady-state simulations, only the
	first time step defined in the “\ *Time Steps*\ ” item in the
	“\ *Project*\ ” drop-down menu on the Main Menu banner is used and,
	starting from the second time step, the time-step length is multiplied
	by a factor of 1.2. For transient simulations, the time-step
	multiplication factor is 1, and the time steps defined in the “\ *Time
	Steps*\ ” dialog box are used. The “\ *Time Steps*\ ” item is discussed
	in Section 7.1.2.

Maximum Outer Iterations: 
	The maximum number of outer iterations (an
	even number generally less than 10) that are to be used to precondition
	the matrices of equations prior to solving. The appropriate number of
	maximum outer iterations depends on the solver that is used and the
	model that is being run. Starting with a smaller number of maximum outer
	iterations and increasing the iteration value as necessary (review the
	.BUD or .OUT files for percent residuals) is recommended to ensure the
	fastest solution time.

Solver: 
	Option for the solver type to be used in the model simulation.
	There are two solver options available in **MINEDW**: PCG
	(Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient) and SAMG (Algebraic Multigrid
	Methods for Systems) (Fraunhofer SCAI 2013).

Outer Iteration Closure Criterion: 
	The head closing criteria for outer
	iterations. Determination of the iteration value depends on the scale of
	the model being simulated. It generally should be less than 1 meter (m)
	or 3 feet (ft). The value should be defined based on computational time,
	accuracy, and mass balance.

Maximum Inner Iterations: 
	Maximum number of inner iterations to solve
	the matrices of equations. This value generally is greater than 1,000,
	depending on the value of the inner iteration closure criterion. Inner
	iterations may often be set to a large value without compromising model
	run time because the solvers use the minimum number of iterations
	necessary to meet the closure criteria.

Inner Iteration Closure Criterion: 
	The closure criterion for the inner
	iterations. This value is generally less than 1 x 10\ :sup:`-10`. The
	smaller the inner closure criterion is, the greater the computational
	accuracy of the results and the longer the computational time.

Output Time Step Frequency to PLB File: 
	The time-step intervals at which **MINEDW** saves the simulated heads 
	to the output file with a .PLB extension. The default value is 1.

7.1.2 Time Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time steps are defined using the “\ *Time Steps*\ ” item in the
“\ *Project*\ ” drop-down menu on the Main Menu banner. During the model
setup, if the user selects “\ *Steady State”* in the *“Project
Properties”* dialog box, then the *“Setup Time Step”* dialog box appears
as shown in Figure 7.2 when “\ *Time Steps*\ ” is selected from the
“\ *Project*\ ” drop-down menu. If the user selects *“Transient”* for
the model run, then the dialog box shown in Figure 7.3 appears. For a
steady-state model, the *“Start Date/Time,”* *“Maximum # of Time
Steps,”* and *“Initial Time Step Length”* are the only inputs that need
to be defined. The *“# of Time steps for this simulation”* defines the
number of time steps to use for a particular model run, but this
parameter is typically the same value as *“Maximum # of Time Steps”* for
steady-state models.

   Figure 7.2 The “\ *Setup Time Step*\ ” dialog box for steady-state
   simulations

There are three different options for defining time steps for a
transient simulation: 1) “\ *Constant*,” 2) “\ *Month*,” or 3)
“\ *Varied*.” If the “\ *Varied*\ ” option is selected, then the data
can be imported from an ASCII data file (the format for the ASCII file
is one column that contains the time-step number and another column that
contains the number of days for each time step; the input time-step file
created by **MINEDW** is in this format). The time steps and the
corresponding dates are shown on the right-hand side of the window
(Figure 7.3). The maximum number of time steps can be defined from the
same window (Figure 7.3). The “\ *Maximum # of Time Steps*\ ” setting
covers all of the time steps for different simulations for a project.

   :align: center

   Figure 7.3 The “\ *Setup Time Step*\ ” dialog box for a transient
   simulation

Under the simulation time-step section (Figure 7.3), the number of time
steps to simulate for a simulation can be set. Using the simulation
time-step slider or entry, the user can specify the number of time steps
to simulate by choosing either a complete model simulation or an
abbreviated model simulation. An abbreviated model simulation will run
for the number of specified time steps.

In the simulation start time drop-down box, a model can be restarted
from a specified time step by selecting the time step at which the
simulation will begin. The simulated head output file (.PLB) must be
read before selecting the restart time step; otherwise, the only
available option is the first time step. Reading in an output file in
**MINEDW** is described in section 9.1. A model simulation should not
be restarted during any part of pit-lake filling.

7.2 Model Geometry
------------------

While the horizontal geometry of the model domain is defined in the mesh
generator, the 3-D layering within the model is defined within the
**MINEDW** GUI using the *“Mesh”* menu. The following sections
describe the functions in the “\ *Mesh”* menu.

7.2.1 Generating the Mesh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The finite-element mesh defines the geometry to simulate a groundwater
system. The **MINEDW** finite-element mesh consists of a solid
configuration of tetrahedrons. Tetrahedrons are difficult solids to use;
therefore, the actual mesh is assembled from prismatic elements that are
triangular in plan view. The prisms are oriented spatially with
sub-horizontal triangular faces and sub-vertical quadrilateral faces.
Three tetrahedrons then are automatically fitted into each prismatic
element.

To allow flexibility in the construction of 3-D meshes, the **MINEDW**
program accepts prismatic elements that have edges with a height of
zero. A prismatic element with one zero-height edge contains two
tetrahedrons and an element with two zero-height edges. These special
elements can be used to represent geologic features that taper to a
thickness of zero or to add vertical refinement in areas of particular
interest. Without these special elements, a vertical zone of fine
vertical discretization can be terminated only by carrying it to the
edge of the model domain.

Generating a **MINEDW** mesh involves performing the following steps:

1. Generate a one-model-layer mesh that incorporates the hydrogeologic
   features in plan view using *Rhinoceros 3D* and Grasshopper (as
   described in Chapter 5) or another mesh generator.

2. Add the ground-surface topography to the main model layer.

3. Add main model layers according to the stratigraphy, geologic
   information, or other data.

4. If needed, add additional vertical model discretization using
   pinch-outs.

7.2.2 Adding Main Model Layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After importing the mesh generated by *Rhinoceros 3D* and Grasshopper
(Chapter 5), main layers can be added by selecting “\ *Define Main
Layer*\ ” from the “\ *Mesh*\ ” drop-down menu found on the Main Menu
banner. A main layer is defined as a layer that extends through the
entire model domain. When “\ *Main Layer*\ ” is selected, the dialog box
shown in Figure 7.4 appears.

To add a new main layer to the model, first select a main layer, then
click “\ *Insert.*\ ” The new main layer will appear above the selected
main layer. The *“Method”* option will be “\ *Constant,”* and the
*“Value”* field will be blank. Select the desired method from the
drop-down box in the “\ *Method”* field if needed, and then enter the
appropriate value in the *“Value”* field. Click “\ *OK*\ ” to add the
main layer with the desired elevation or thickness. Note: if the
*“Average”* method is selected, then no value is needed in the *“Value”*
field. The new main layer is placed above the originally selected main
layer. An example of the information required for main layers is
described below.

   Figure 7.4 The “\ *Define Main Nodal Layers*\ ” dialog box with layer
   definition

The method of defining the elevation of the main layers in Figure 7.4
includes five options, as shown in Figure 7.5, below.

.. figure:: media/figure_7_5_manual.png
   :width: 0.89596in
   :height: 1.01056in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.5 The “\ *Method*\ ” drop-down box showing the available
   options

The five options available for main layer creation are the following:

No Change: 
	This option retains the existing elevation for the selected
	main layer.

Constant: 
	This option assigns a constant-elevation value.

Average: 
	This option assigns an average elevation of two layers to the
	newly created main layer or layers. This option is not available for the
	top and bottom main layers.

Thickness: 
	This option assigns the elevation by using the defined
	thickness from the main layer below. This option is not available when
	adding the bottom layer of the model.

Depth: 
	This option assigns the elevation by using the defined depth
	from the main layer above. This option is not available when defining
	the elevation of the top layer of the model.

The following are examples for inserting several main model layers into
**MINEDW**:

-  *Constant:* Adding a main layer using the *“Constant”* method will
   add a nodal layer at the elevation specified in the *“Value”* field.
   A nodal layer (creating two new element layers) can be added anywhere
   using this method, but care must be taken to ensure that the new
   layer falls between the nodes of the upper and lower node layers.


-  *Average:* To add a main layer with an average thickness (Figure
   7.6), select a layer and click “\ *Insert*.” **MINEDW** will insert
   a nodal layer above the selected layer. Select “\ *Average*\ ” from
   the “\ *Method*\ ” drop-down box and click “\ *OK*.” **MINEDW**
   adds a new nodal layer (as shown within the red box) between the top
   and bottom nodal layers, forming two element layers. Node elevations
   for this layer are calculated as the average of the top nodal layer
   and the bottom nodal layer.

   :width: 5.67in
   :height: 1.81in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.6 Layer definition using the “\ *Average”* method

-  *Thickness:* The *“Thickness”* option will create a nodal layer
   (shown within the red box) that is offset by a user-specified value
   from the nodal layer immediately below, as seen in Figure 7.7. This
   creates an element layer with elements of uniform thickness. Figure
   7.7 displays a nodal layer that has a constant elevation and an
   element layer of uniform thickness; however, it is possible to create
   a nodal layer that does not have a constant elevation but that forms
   an element layer of uniform thickness. This occurs when the reference
   nodal layer does not have a constant elevation.

   Figure 7.7 Layer definition using the “\ *Thickness”* method

-  *Depth:* The “\ *Depth”* method is similar to the *“Thickness”*
   method, with the exception that the upper nodal layer (rather than
   the lower nodal layer) is used as the reference layer to calculate
   the location of the nodal layer that is being added. In contrast to
   the nodal layer with uniform elevation, shown in Figure 7.7, the
   nodal layer in Figure 7.8 does not have a uniform elevation because
   the upper nodal layer that was used as the reference to calculate the
   location of the new nodal layer did not have a uniform elevation.

7.2.3 Using Topography Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following describes how to add topographic information to the first
model layer, but the same steps can be repeated to apply topography to
any model layer.

To incorporate topography in a model, select the “\ *List*\ ” tab in the
“\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane on the right-hand side of the **MINEDW**
Main Menu. Expand the “\ *Node*\ ” item by double-clicking “\ *Node*\ ”
or clicking on the small triangle next to “\ *Node.*\ ” Next,
double-click “\ *3D Contour,*\ ” as shown in Figure 7.9. The mesh will
be displayed in the View Pane.

Click the “\ *Select*\ ” tool on the toolbar. From the “\ *Control
Panel*\ ” Pane on the right-hand side of the **MINEDW** window, select
the “\ *Attributes*\ ” tab. Make sure that “\ *Layer 1*\ ” is selected
and “\ *Elevation*\ ” (in the “\ *Color By*\ ” drop-down box) is
selected, as shown in Figure 7.10.

   Figure 7.10 The “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane showing the “\ *Attributes*\ ” 
   tab with “\ *Layer*\ ” set to “\ *1*\ ”

In the **MINEDW** View Pane, use the cursor to click and drag a box
around the whole domain to select all of the nodes in Layer 1. Press the
[Enter] key to open the dialog box shown in Figure 7.11. Click the
button next to “\ *Interpolate From File,*\ ” and the “\ *Open Data
File*\ ” dialog box appears. Select a file with XYZ data (this file is
formatted as columns of x, y, and z data) that contains the topographic
information that will be added to the model, and click “\ *Open.*\ ” The
“\ *Grid*\ ” dialog box shown in Figure 7.12 appears. Define the
interpolation method (“*Inverse* *Distance*\ ” or “\ *Kriging*\ ”) and
the required parameters, and then click “\ *OK.*\ ” **MINEDW** assigns
the topographic information contained in the data file to the top layer
of the model using the interpolation method. This method can be used to
assign elevation data to all of the nodal layers in the model. To assign
elevation data to other nodal layers, simply select the desired layer on
the “\ *Attributes”* tab of the “\ *3-D Contour”* plot item and repeat
the steps described above.

To view the ground-surface elevation contours, add an “\ *Isoline”* plot
item and select “\ *Elevation”* as the “\ *Color By”* attribute. The
counter intervals may be manipulated by using the options under the
*“Contour”* attribute of the “\ *Isoline”* plot item. Click on the
“\ *Attributes*\ ” tab in the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane, and then click
on the small triangle next to “\ *Contour.*\ ” Deselect the “\ *Auto*\ ”
box next to “\ *Interval*\ ” and replace the current value with a
different value, then press the [Enter] key, and elevation contours
appear. An example of ground-surface elevation contours is shown in
Figure 7.13.

7.2.4 Importing Node Elevations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Node elevations can be assigned to all of the nodes in the model domain
by importing a node-elevation file. Node elevations are written to a
file called “\ *node.fem”* by the **MINEDW** GUI. This file is a
simple text file that can easily be created using another **MINEDW**
model or other software. The file contains five columns of data: 1) node
number, 2) *x* location of node, 3) y location of node, 4) *z* location
(or elevation) of node, and 5) node layer.

To import and assign node elevations for the entire domain, select
“\ *Import Elevations From Node File”* found under the *“Project”*
drop-down menu on the Main Menu banner. Use the *“Import Node File”*
dialog box that opens to navigate to the location of the node elevation
file. Select it and click *“Open”* to complete the assignment. The
default file type for node elevations in **MINEDW** is the .FEM file
type. **MINEDW** creates three files with the .FEM extension, but only
the “node.fem” file can be used to import node elevations.

7.2.5 Defining a Pinch-Out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**MINEDW** provides the option of adding areas of increased vertical
discretization. The enhanced vertical discretization is referred to as a
pinch-out because layers terminate in areas where increased vertical
discretization is not needed. To define the pinch-out types, select
“\ *Mesh*\ ” from the Main Menu banner and then select “\ *Define
Pinch-Out*.” The “\ *Define Pinch-Outs*\ ” dialog box appears (Figure
7.14).

.. figure:: media/figure_7_14_manual.png
   :width: 3.76094in
   :height: 4.90693in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.14 The “\ *Define Pinch-Outs*\ ” dialog box

In **MINEDW**, various pinch-out configurations can be defined and
simulated. Each configuration is defined as one type of pinch-out. Based
on their modeling needs, the user can define as many pinch-out types as
necessary. Each type can contain pinch-outs of as many layers as needed.

Figure 7.15 illustrates the working principle of the pinch-out method.
For example, a model has four regional layers that are each represented
(sequentially, Layer 1 to Layer 4, from top to bottom) by a row of black
squares in Figure 7.15. The left column shows the number of pinch-out
layers (shown in blue) allowed for each model layer. For illustration
purposes, three different combinations are represented, which are each
defined as a different type in Figure 7.15. Type 1 consists of three
pinch-outs on model Layer 2 (represented as red lines). Type 2 consists
of three pinch-outs on model Layer 2 (represented as red lines) and two
pinch-outs on model Layer 3 (represented as a green line). Type 3
consists of two pinch-outs on model Layer 3 (represented as a green
line). Only one number of pinch-outs can be defined for each model
layer. For example, in Figure 7.15, model Layer 2 cannot have three
pinch-outs in one area and two pinch-outs in another area. In this
example, there will be exactly three pinch-outs anywhere pinch-outs are
added to model Layer 2.

   Figure 7.15 Schematic explanation of pinch-outs

To define pinch-outs, click the “\ *Add*\ ” button on the right side of
the “\ *Define Pinch-Outs*\ ” dialog box. Type the number of pinch-outs
for each layer in the column labeled *“# of Sublayers,*\ ” and enable
the pinch-out for the related layer by checking the box. Figure 7.16
shows how to define pinch-outs to achieve the schematic shown in Figure
7.15. When the pinch-out types are completely defined, click “\ *OK*.”

   Figure 7.16 The “\ *Define Pinch-Outs*\ ” dialog box

In this example, “\ *Type 1*\ ” will have three pinch-outs in Layer 2,
while “\ *Type 2*\ ” will have the same three pinch-outs in Layer 2 as
well as two pinch-outs in Layer 3. “\ *Type 3*\ ” pinch-outs will have
only two pinch-outs in Layer 3. To assign pinch-outs to an area, select
the “\ *List*\ ” tab in the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane. Expand the
“\ *Element*\ ” item and double-click “\ *Pinch-Out.*\ ” From the main
window, click the “\ *Select*\ ” tool on the Main Menu banner. Then use
the “\ *Select with Polygon*\ ” tool to select the area where pinch-outs
are to be added. Figure 7.17 shows an example of the nodes being
selected for adding pinch-outs.

7.2.6 Modifying the Mesh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the “\ *Modify Mesh*\ ” function in **MINEDW**, the user can
extend the model domain and refine the mesh after it is created or at
any time during the model setup. The mesh can be refined in a
user-specified location or extended to cover a larger area.

To refine the mesh, click “\ *Modify Mesh*\ ” from the “\ *Mesh*\ ”
drop-down menu found on the Main Menu banner. This will open an “\ *Open
BLN File*\ ” dialog box (Figure 7.20). Select a .BLN file that defines
an area inside the current model domain to refine and click “\ *Open.”*

**MINEDW** can also extend the mesh after it has been created. Click
“\ *Modify Mesh*\ ” from the “\ *Mesh*\ ” drop-down menu found on the
Main Menu banner. The area to be extended is defined by a .BLN file
created in *Surfer™* or in a text editor. When “\ *Modify Mesh*\ ” is
selected from the “\ *Mesh*\ ” drop-down menu, the “\ *Open BLN File*\ ”
dialog box shown in Figure 7.20 appears. Select the .BLN file defining
the area to be extended. Click “\ *Open.*\ ” The “\ *Refine Mesh*\ ”
dialog box shown in Figure 7.21 appears. Enter the mesh density and
click “\ *OK.*\ ” Figure 7.23 shows the mesh before and after the mesh
extension.

7.3 Zone Properties – Hydraulic Parameters
------------------------------------------

This section describes the zone properties (hydraulic parameters) that
are assigned to the model. The term “zone” is a synonym for the type of
aquifer material that composes the element; each element is assigned a
zone type. Consequently, the zone definitions change only when the user
moves a geologic boundary or defines a new geologic material (zone).
Zone definitions include the hydraulic conductivity, specific storage,
specific yield, and the principal directions of the hydraulic
conductivity field, which can be specified in the *x*, *y*, and *z*
directions.

The hydraulic parameters that characterize each zone are defined by
selecting “\ *Project*\ ” and then “\ *Zone Properties*\ ” (Figure
7.24).

   Angle3 (Ψ)

After defining the “\ *Zone Properties,*\ ” see the explanation in
Section 6.1 on how to select elements and assign them with the created
hydrogeological zones.

7.3.1 Zone Distributions (para.fem)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As described in Section 6.1, hydraulic zone properties can be assigned
using the “\ *Select”* tool and the *“Select Geology Zone”* dialog box
or a 3-D .DXF. Another method is to import a “para.fem” file, which
contains the hydraulic zone definition for each element in the model
domain. This file consists of three columns of data: 1) the element
number, 2) the hydraulic zone number, and 3) the element layer number.
This file can be created using another **MINEDW** model with the same
domain or other software.

To import a “para.fem” file and change the distribution of hydraulic
parameters of a model, click on *“Import Zones from Parameter File”*
under the *“Project”* drop-down menu on the Main Menu banner. Using the
*“Import Zone File”* dialog box, navigate to the location of the
“para.fem” file, select it, and click *“Open.”* The new hydraulic zone
distribution will be assigned to the model domain.

7.3.2 Zone Properties (kfile.dat)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New parameter values for hydraulic zones can be imported into
**MINEDW** from the “kfile.dat” file, which can be edited by any text
editor. To import a new “kfile.dat,” open the *“Zone Properties”* dialog
box (Figure 7.24). Using the *“Import”* button, open the *“Open Zone
Properties File”* dialog box. Navigate to the location of the new or
updated “kfile.dat,” select it, and click *“Open.”* The parameter values
will be updated in the *“Zone Properties”* dialog box.

7.4 Boundary Conditions
-----------------------

A groundwater flow model requires an appropriate set of boundary
conditions to describe the mathematical problem that will be solved. In
**MINEDW**, six types of boundary conditions are available: 1)
constant head, 2) variable flux, 3) pumping well, 4) rivers, 5)
recharge, and 6) evaporation. Of these six types, constant head,
variable flux, pumping wells, and rivers are assigned to nodes, while
recharge and evaporation zones are assigned to elements.

To define the boundary conditions, select “\ *BCs*\ ” from the Main Menu
banner, then choose the appropriate boundary-condition type from the
“\ *BCs*\ ” drop-down menu (Figure 7.26). Each boundary-condition type
requires a different set of parameters, as described below. (Note that
the data-input windows have similar features and functionality).

   Figure 7.26 The “\ *BCs*\ ” drop-down menu

Boundary conditions are assigned using node or element plot items. Use
the “\ *Assign Properties for Nodes”* dialog box to assign “\ *Constant
Head & Drain,*\ ” “\ *Variable-Flux,”* and “\ *Pumping Well*\ ” boundary
conditions. The “\ *Assign Properties for Nodes*\ ” dialog box shown in
Figure 7.27 can be accessed by adding a “\ *2D Contour*\ ” or “\ *3D
Contour*\ ” plot item from the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane. Select the
desired nodes and then press [Enter] to bring up the dialog box.

   Figure 7.27 The “\ *Assign Node Properties*\ ” dialog box

Recharge and evaporation boundary conditions can be applied to the model
using a “\ *2-D Plane”* plot item. To assign recharge or evaporation to
the model, access the “\ *Select* *Recharge Zone*\ ” or “\ *Select
Evaporation Zone”* dialog box, shown in Figures 7.28 and 7.29,
respectively, by adding a “\ *2-D Plane*\ ” element plot item from the
“\ *Control Panel*\ ” and then selecting the desired “\ *Color By*\ ”
attribute, “\ *Recharge,*\ ” or “\ *Evaporation*.”

Next, select the desired elements using the methods described in Section
6.1, press [Enter], and the “\ *Select Recharge Zone*\ ” or “\ *Select
Evaporation Zone*\ ” dialog box appears. Assigning recharge and
evaporation boundary conditions is described in more detail in Sections
7.4.6 and 7.4.7.

   Figure 7.29 The “\ *Select Evaporation Zone*\ ” dialog box

All boundary conditions can be applied as time-varying conditions. The
implementation of these time-varying conditions is described in Section
7.4.1 below, which is followed by a description of each type of boundary
condition available in **MINEDW**.

7.4.1 Time-Series Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Time-series data can be imported from files or directly defined in the
time-series dialog boxes (Figure 7.30) that are available within the
different boundary-condition dialog boxes. A time series consists of a
user-defined number of data pairs (time, value).

.. figure:: media/figure_7_30_manual.png
   :width: 6.00000in
   :height: 2.34653in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.30 The time-series editor

There are three different options in **MINEDW** for the input of
time-series data (Figure 7.31):

Constant: 
	The boundary-condition data is constant, regardless of time.

Annual: 
	The values are defined for a year and repeated each year for
	the entire model-simulation time period.

Varied: 
	The values are defined over time.

   :width: 2.23585in
   :height: 0.38018in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.31 Time-series input options

Time-series data can be imported from a text file (the format for the
text file is described in Appendix B). The plot on the left-hand side
displays the time-series data. For any period during which the pump is
turned off, enter “0” for wells that are defined as “\ *Pumping Rate*\ ”
or “\ *LPE*\ ” wells (lowest pumping elevation wells) and “N/A” or
“-99999999” for wells that are defined as “\ *Specified Head*\ ” wells.
Time-series data can also be exported to a .DAT file. After any
modifications, make sure to click *“Apply”* to save the changes.

7.4.2 Constant Head
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *Constant Head*\ ” option is used to implement specified-head
boundary conditions, which can take the following forms:

-  The constant-head boundary is invariant with time (constant time
   series).

-  The constant-head boundary varies with time in accordance with a
   specified hydrograph, which is input in the form of a table of the
   hydraulic heads at specified times (varied time series).

-  The constant-head boundary varies annually in accordance with a
   specified hydrograph, which is input in the form of a table of the
   annual hydraulic heads (annual time series).

-  The boundary condition is simulated as a drainage node. A drainage
   node is the condition in which water can discharge from—but not
   into—the groundwater system. This condition can exist if groundwater
   can discharge to a subsurface drainpipe, to the pit wall, or to
   underground workings. Time-series data can also be applied to drain
   nodes and represent the time-varying head (drain level) at the drain
   node. Ensure that drain levels are not lower than the elevation of
   the node that the drain is defined on and that drain levels do not
   exceed the elevation of the node directly above the drain. If this
   occurs, **MINEDW** will provide the user with a warning and the
   drain node will not be simulated properly.

“\ *Constant Head*\ ” nodes and “\ *Drain*\ ” nodes can be deactivated
(turned off) at any time during the simulation by entering the
appropriate date and a value of “-99999999” in the time-series window.
Entering a value of “0” for either boundary condition will not
deactivate the boundary condition, but rather, it will assign the
boundary condition a constant head or drain level of 0 m.

When “\ *Constant Head*\ ” is selected from the “\ *BCs*\ ” drop-down
menu, the dialog box in Figure 7.32 appears. The required data for a
constant-head boundary condition are described below.

.. figure:: media/figure_7_32_manual.png

   :align: center

   Figure 7.32 The “\ *Constant-Head Boundary*\ ” dialog box

Enable Nonlinear Flow: 
	Option to simulate nonlinear groundwater flow
	at drains and constant heads. If enabled, the user has the option to
	enable nonlinear flow for every group. If the user chooses to use
	nonlinear flow, they must define the nonlinear flow ratio. The nonlinear
	flow ratio is the ratio of Non-Darcian to Darcian flow; a value of 0
	indicates the flow is completely Darcian.

Group Definition: 
	The “\ *Group Definition”* portion of the “\ *Constant-Head Boundary”* 
	dialog box allows the user to define groups of constant-head or drain 
	boundary conditions.

Constant-head or drain groups are added by clicking the “\ *Add*\ ”
button at the top of the dialog box. With the drop-down box (Figure
7.32), next to the *“Activate”* checkbox select either *“Constant
Head”* or *“Drain”* to define the type of boundary condition thegroup will be. 
Each group added will appear in the “\ *Groups*\ ” drop-down list shown 
in Figure 7.33. The names of each group can be
modified as desired, as shown in Figure 7.33. Use the “\ *Delete*\ ”
button to remove unneeded group names, and check or uncheck the
“\ *Active”* box to activate or deactivate constant-head and drain
groups. If nonlinear flow is to be simulated for the constant-head
or drain group, check the box next to *“NonLinear Flow”* and input a
value for *“Ratio.”*

Constant-head groups allow the user to group constant-head nodes or
drain nodes together to calculate the flux for each constant-head
group (e.g., a set of sub-horizontal drain holes or a regional
constant-head boundary). Output flux with respect to time is
calculated for each group and is output in the flow file (.FLW).

	The node number where the constant-head boundary condition is defined.

Group: 
	The constant-head group to which a particular node is assigned.
	Using the drop-down box below “\ *Group Definition*,” the user can
	select any of the constant-head groups.

Type drop-down list: 
	This drop-down list is located to the right of
	the “Group” drop-down list. It is used to specify the type of
	constant-head node (constant-head or drain node).

Head: 
	Constant-head elevation; if constant, varied, or annual,
	constant-head elevations can be edited in the time-series data box on
	the right side of the *“Constant-Head Boundary”* dialog box.

Leakance: 
	Leakance factor (square meters per day [m\ :sup:`2`/day] or
	square feet per day [ft\ :sup:`2`/day]). Leakance factors can be
	“\ *Constant*,” “\ *Annual*,” or “\ *Varied*.” These options are
	available in the lower time-series data box on the right side of the
	*“Constant-Head Boundary”* dialog box.

Once the constant-head groups are defined, constant-head nodes can be
assigned in several different ways. First, a “\ *2D Contour”* or *“3D
Contour”* plot item can be added and nodes can be selected (as described
in Section 6.2) to bring up the “\ *Assign Properties for Nodes*\ ”
dialog box shown in Figure 7.34. Here, the boundary conditions for the
selected nodes can be modified. Once the “\ *Add to Constant-Head
Boundary*\ ” button is clicked, the user has the option to select the
constant-head group from a drop-down menu as well as the layers to which
the constant head will be applied, with the top layer being the one
selected in the “\ *Plot Item*\ ” attributes menu.

   Figure 7.34 The “\ *Assign Properties for Nodes*\ ” dialog box and
   constant-head groups

Additionally, constant-head nodes can be created in the
“\ *Constant-Head Boundary*\ ” dialog box (Figure 7.32) in several
different ways. First, a “chead.dat” file from a previous model data set
can be imported using the “\ *Import*\ ” button. Also, constant-head
nodes can be defined using a .BLN file and the “\ *Create*\ ” button.
This function can be used to quickly create sub-horizontal drain holes,
which are commonly used in mining operations to minimize pore pressures
in the pit wall. To use this function, click “\ *Create,*\ ” and a
“\ *Select BLN File*\ ” window opens. Select the .BLN file representing
the sub-horizontal drain hole and click “\ *OK*.” Drain nodes will be
created at nodes close to the .BLN file. The drain elevation assigned by
default to each of the drain nodes will be the node elevation. Finally,
constant-head nodes can be created manually by entering the required
parameters in the table.

Parameters of the constant-head nodes can be edited by group using the
“\ *Group”* drop-down box. When the name of each constant-head group is
selected, the nodes composing the group appear in the window below the
drop-down box. After selecting the desired group, the constant-head
nodes composing the group can be selected by clicking in the upper
left-hand corner of the table. Once the nodes in the desired group are
selected, they may be edited as a group by entering values for
“\ *Head”* or *“Leakance”* in the appropriate time-series window.

When a “\ *Constant Head*\ ” or “\ *Drain*\ ” record is selected, the
time-series dialog becomes active. In the time-series dialog, the user
is able to import time-series data for constant heads or drain nodes.
The three options are 1) “\ *Constant,*\ ” 2) “\ *Annual,*\ ” and 3)
“\ *Varied.*\ ” These options are explained in the beginning of this
section.

7.4.3 Variable-Flux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *Variable-Flux*\ ” boundary condition is used to specify
variable-flux boundary conditions. The variable-flux boundary is used to
simulate a domain of large extent without the need to greatly extend the
model domain. The “\ *Variable-Flux*\ ” option applies the analytical
solution for a semi-infinite aquifer to the boundary of the modeled flow
domain. To ensure that the variable-flux boundary conditions are
implemented properly, the actual boundary of the model domain should be
far enough from any hydraulic stress so that effects from these
hydraulic stresses do not reach the variable-flux boundary condition.

To add a variable-flux boundary condition to the model, add a *“2D
Contour”* or *“3D Contour”* plot item to the View Pane. Next, toggle to
the desired node layer using the *“Layer”* attribute of the *“2D
Contour”* or *“3D Contour”* plot item. Use the “\ *Select*\ ” tool from
the toolbar to select the nodes on the edge of the model domain where
the variable-flux boundary condition is to be assigned. When the nodes
are selected, press the [Enter] key to open the *“Assign Properties for
Nodes”* dialog box. Check the radio button next to *“Assign to
Variable-Flux Boundary”;* this will activate additional options. The
additional options are *“All nodes in between (counterclockwise) are
selected,*\ ” which will assign the variable-flux boundary condition to
all the perimeter nodes of the model domain between two selected nodes
in a counterclockwise direction, and *“From Current Layer # To,”* which
will assign the variable-flux boundary condition from the currently
selected layer to the chosen layer. The nodes that have a variable-flux
boundary condition assigned can be modified using the *“Variable-Flux
Boundary”* dialog box under the “\ *BCs*\ ” drop-down menu found on the
Main Menu banner at the top of the screen. The *“Variable-Flux
Boundary”* dialog box is shown in Figure 7.35. The information that can
be modified for the variable-flux boundary condition is described below.

Option to *Apply Constant Flux from Steady-State Simulation:* Note that
this requires a .DRN file from a steady-state simulation. To import the
.DRN file, click *“Import from DRN File”* and navigate to the location
of the .DRN file using the *“Open Variable Flux File”* window.

7.4.4 Pumping Well
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option is used to specify values for source/sink terms modeled as
pumping wells. When “\ *Pumping Well*\ ” is selected from the
“\ *BCs*\ ” drop-down menu found on the Main Menu banner at the top of
the screen, the dialog box shown in Figure 7.36 appears. In
**MINEDW**, there are three options available for pumping wells.
Pumping wells can be introduced to the model by defining pumping rates,
specified heads, or pumping rates with an LPE (“*Pumping Rate,”
“Specified Head*,” or “\ *Pumping with LPE”*).

Pumping wells can be added to the model by importing a previously
created “pumpwells.dat” file; the format of this file is discussed in
Appendix B. To import the file, simply click on *“Import”* and, using
the *“Open Pumping File”* window that opens, navigate to the location of
the “pumpwells.dat” file, select it, and click *“Open.”* Note, if there
are any existing wells in the *“Pumping Well”* dialog box, they will be
overwritten and replaced with the contents of the “pumpwells.dat” file.

Pumping wells can be created by **MINEDW** based on *x*, *y*, and *z*
data in a .DAT file. To use this function, the file should contain three
columns of *x*, *y*, and *z* data corresponding to the locations of the
pumps to be created in the model. Click on the *“Create”* button and,
using the *“Select DAT file”* window that opens, navigate to the
directory containing the file with location data for the pumps, select
it, and click *“Open*.” **MINEDW** will select the finite-element node
at the specified *x*, *y*, and *z* locations, or if no node exists at a
location, **MINEDW** will move the closest node to that specified
location. The user can then use the *“Pumping Well”* dialog box to
modify the screen intervals, pumping rate, and pumping well type.

Another option for adding pumping wells to the model is to select the
nodes where pumping wells are to be simulated using a *“2D Contour”* or
*“3D Contour”* plot item and the “\ *Select*\ ” tool and then choosing
*“Add to Pumping Wells”* in the *“Assign Properties for Nodes”* dialog
box as described in Section 6.2. The user must take care to select the
correct node layer in the *“3D Contour”* plot item where the pumping
well is to be simulated. For example, if the user inadvertently uses the
top node layer, the pump or sink will be simulated at the top of the
model domain and will likely be ineffective at removing groundwater from
the system. Also, the user will have to specify the screen intervals,
pumping well type, and pumping rates in the *“Pumping Well”* dialog box
after adding pumping wells using this method.

.. figure:: media/figure_7_36_manual.png
   :width: 5.73155in
   :height: 3.71457in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.36 The “\ *Pumping Well*\ ” dialog box

In **MINEDW,** a “\ *Pumping Rate”* well allows the user to specify
the exact pumping rates they want to use for a model simulation. This
type of pumping well is useful for a model calibration simulation when
field-recorded pumping-rate data are available. As mentioned above,
using a “\ *Pumping Rate”* well may dry out the groundwater system
within the vicinity of the pumping well if the pumping rate is too large
or the hydraulic conductivity values assigned are too low. **MINEDW**
will print a warning to the “MINEDW.err” file if this occurs during a
model simulation, but it is the user’s responsibility to check this
file, as **MINEDW** does not stop running when this occurs.

*“Pumping Rate”* wells have the option to move to the first wet node if
the node where the pump is located becomes dry. This option should be
exercised with care, as ***MINEDW*** will continue to move the pumping
node lower, which may result in the pumping node moving to the bottom of
the model domain. A pumping node located at the bottom of the model
domain (on a no-flux boundary) is incorrect, as pumping stresses should
not propagate to a boundary condition. If the user wishes to use this
option, they are advised to check that pumping stresses never intersect
other user-defined boundary conditions as the pumping node moves
downward. To activate this option, check the box next to “\ *Well
(Pumping Rate only) will be moved to first wet node when dry,*\ ” and
the nodes defined as a “\ *Pumping Rate”* well will be moved to the next
wet node when the pumping nodes become dry.

“\ *Enable* *Nonlinear Flow”* enables nonlinear flow for pumping wells.
If this option is enabled, the *“Nonlinear”* field will become visible
in the *“Pumping Well”* dialog box. Each well where nonlinear flow is to
be simulated will need to be enabled individually. The required
information for the “\ *Pumping Well*\ ” dialog box is described below.

Name: 
	Name of the pumping well.

Node #: 
	Identity of node in the pumping data set.

Type: 
	Switch for the type of pumping well (options available are
	“\ *Pumping Rate*,” “\ *Specified Head*,” and “\ *Pumping with LPE*\ ”).

Screen Top: 
	Elevation of screen top (in meters or feet).

Screen Bottom: 
	Elevation of screen bottom (in meters or feet).

Level: 
	Defined as either the LPE or the specified head depending on
	the type of well defined.

Nonlinear: 
	Enables nonlinear for the selected well.

Ratio: 
	The ratio to use for nonlinear flow.

After selecting a pumping well in the “\ *Pumping Well”* dialog box, the
time-series menu becomes active, as shown in Figure 7.36. In this menu,
the user can import time-series data for each type of pumping. The three
options are “\ *Constant*,” “\ *Annual*,” and “\ *Varied*\ ” (as
described in Section 7.4.1).

*“Specified Head”* pumping wells are analogues to drains because they
can be used to achieve a specific-head value within the groundwater
system surrounding the well by extracting the necessary amount of water.
Unlike drains, however, no leakance values need to be defined for
“\ *Specified Head”* wells. *“Specified Head”* wells are often used in
predictive simulations to evaluate dewatering requirements. When used
for this purpose, the objective is to achieve the dewatering needs of
the project and quantify the amount of water that will need to be
extracted to achieve the dewatering target. After quantifying the
dewatering requirements, the physical well can be designed to achieve
the simulated pumping rates. However, if a “\ *Specified Head”* well is
used to simulate an existing well, it would be prudent to ensure that
the calculated pumping rates of the simulated well do not exceed the
maximum pumping rate of the physical well.

Finally, the “\ *LPE*\ ” well, which is typically used in a predictive
simulation, is defined by assigning a pumping rate to the well and the
LPE. The LPE allows the user to specify the minimum allowable head in a
well. If the head within the well is equal to or less than the LPE, the
pumping rate will be reduced in order to maintain the LPE until the head
exceeds the LPE. If the head exceeds the LPE, then the *“LPE”* well will
pump at the rate defined by the user. This feature allows the user to
ensure that a proper water-column height is maintained or that the
groundwater system does not become dry due to either high pumping rates
or low permeability. If an “\ *LPE*\ ” well is used during calibration,
the user should compare pumping rates printed in the .FLW file with
those that were assigned. If rates in the .FLW file are less than the
rates that were assigned, this may indicate that the hydraulic
parameters assigned to the model are too low. Conversely, assigning
maximum pumping rates to *“LPE”* wells during predictive simulations
allows the user to determine the maximum pumping rates that can be
sustained with the assigned hydraulic parameters.

7.4.5 Rivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *River*\ ” boundary condition is used to simulate interactions
between a routed river and an aquifer. The routed-river function uses
Manning’s equation to calculate the flow in an open channel. A given
reach of the river is represented by a node and corresponding reach
length. Each reach is connected to the next reach by sequencing the
nodes from upstream to downstream. River-groundwater system interactions
are simulated by comparing the head in the groundwater system to the
head in the river over time and by transferring water across the
riverbed accordingly. Rivers can be connected to form a river network.
External sources of water to rivers are termed “tributaries.”

The physical accuracy of a river’s representation depends upon the
number of nodes used to resolve the geometry of the river in plan view
and the physical coefficients used to calculate gains and losses to and
from the river.

When “\ *River*\ ” is selected from the “\ *BCs*\ ” drop-down menu on
the Main Menu banner at the top of the screen, the dialog box shown in
Figure 7.37 appears.

.. figure:: media/figure_7_37_manual.png

   :height: 3.50972in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.37 The “\ *River*\ ” tab of the “\ *River*\ ” dialog box

Rivers are defined by clicking the “\ *Add*\ ” button at the top of the
“\ *River”* tab of the “\ *River”* dialog box. Unlike boundary
conditions such as pumping wells, constant heads, drains, or
variable-flux boundaries, rivers cannot be created using any plot items.
A river can only be created in the following two ways:

1. From a “BLN” File: This is done by clicking the “\ *Create*\ ” button
   on the lower right of the “\ *River”* tab, which opens the
   *“Select BLN file”* dialog box. After selecting the appropriate
   .BLN file, click “\ *Open*\ ” and **MINEDW** automatically
   selects the appropriate nodes based on distance from the .BLN
   defined line. **MINEDW** then calculates the riverbed
   elevations and the elevation difference between the upstream and
   downstream node.

2. Manually: The user can manually enter node numbers; riverbed
   elevations can then be automatically generated by **MINEDW**
   using the “\ *Follow Topo*\ ” button.

For any river, the user has the choice of calculating the slope based
off the topography using “\ *Follow Topo,”* which is the default
setting, or applying a “\ *Constant Slope.*\ ” For the “\ *Constant
Slope”* option for the entire river channel, the *“Slope”* box will
become active and the “\ *Bed Elev.”* column of the table will no longer
be visible. The slope of all segments of the river will be constant. If
the *“Constant Slope”* option is used, then the *“First (Lowest) Node
Bed Elevation”* is used as a reference to calculate other bed
elevations. When using “\ *Constant Slope,”* if the river is connected
to another river, the elevation of the node that forms the river
connection is used as the reference elevation rather than the *“First
(Lowest) Node”* and “\ *Bed Elev.”*

For each river, the “\ *Manning Coefficient.*\ ” river channel
“\ *Width,*\ ” “\ *First (Lowest) Node,*\ ” *“Bed Elev.,”* and bed
hydraulic conductivity must be defined. The following is an explanation
of the required information:

Manning’s Coefficient: 
	Empirical coefficient for river depth [TL\ :sup:`-1/3`].

Width: 
	Coefficient for river width [L].

First (Lowest) Node: 
	The node number of the lowest node, which should
	correspond to the first node forming the river.

Bed Elev.: 
	The elevation of the riverbed at the downstream node
	forming the river [L].


**Additionally**, for each node composing the river, the following must be
defined:

Node: 
	The node number for nodes forming the river.

Riverbed elevation: 
	The elevation of the riverbed at the node
	(optional if “\ *Constant Slope*\ ” is used) [L].

Bed Conductivity: 
	The riverbed hydraulic conductivity [LT\ :sup:`-1`].

Output: 
	Option to print simulation results for the node to the output
	file. At a minimum the results at the end node, or any connected node,
	will be printed out.

Next, “\ *Tributaries*\ ” are entered. “\ *Tributaries”* are inflows of
water to the river and can be used to simulate inflow from outside the
model domain or discharge from an outfall such as a lined channel, pump,
etc. inside of the model domain. The flow from a tributary can be
“\ *Constant,*\ ” “\ *Annual,*\ ” or “\ *Varied*.” Figure 7.38 shows the
“\ *Tributary*\ ” tab of the “\ *River*\ ” dialog box.

Tributaries are added by clicking the “\ *Add*\ ” button at the top of
the window and specifying the node at which the inflow occurs. The start
date of the inflow and the amount of inflow in m\ :sup:`3`/day or cubic
feet per day (ft\ :sup:`3`/day) can be specified in the time-series table
on the lower right. The graph to the left of the table shows the inflow
values over time. A time series may be imported as a .DAT file using the
“\ *Import* *Series*\ ” button.

The last tab in the “\ *River*\ ” dialog box, shown in Figure 7.39,
describes the connections between individual rivers and between rivers
and tributaries. The user does not need to specify the connection points
but can check here to ensure that the rivers and tributaries are
connected correctly. If any changes to the river network have been made
or a new river network has been created, clicking the “\ *Refresh*\ ”
button redefines the connections.

7.4.6 Recharge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**MINEDW** can simulate temporal and spatial variation in recharge.
Spatial variation in recharge can be added to a **MINEDW** model by
creating any number of recharge zones and applying those zones to the
model domain. Time-series precipitation data can be used to add temporal
recharge information to each zone. With **MINEDW**, the user can also
create zones with orographically controlled recharge, which may be
useful for mountainous regions.

When “\ *Recharge*\ ” is selected from the “\ *BCs*\ ” drop-down menu on
the Main Menu banner at the top of the screen, the dialog box shown in
Figure 7.40 appears. To create a recharge zone with only temporal
variation in recharge, select the “\ *Temporal”* tab and then choose
*“Constant,” “Annual,”* or “\ *Varied”* for the type of time-series
recharge data that will be defined. Next, define the start date and
recharge rate in the box below. Note that if the elevation function for
recharge is used, then the values defined in the time-series window will
not be precipitation rates but rather will be scaling factors. The
elevation function for recharge and scaling factors that can be applied
are explained on the following pages. A time-series chart appears in the
window to the left, displaying the defined data. Note that the units
used in this dialog box are specified in the uppermost portion of the
window.

.. figure:: media/figure_7_40_manual.png
   :width: 5.70417in
   :height: 3.62292in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.40 The “\ *Recharge*\ ” dialog box showing the
   “\ *Temporal*\ ” tab

The “\ *Elevation”* tab in the “\ *Recharge”* dialog box allows the user
to create zones of orographically controlled recharge. Using this
method, the net recharge to the groundwater system can be calculated as
a percentage (0–100%) of the total precipitation that falls in
orographically controlled precipitation zones. This method works well
for groundwater models that include mountain and valley systems.

Orographically controlled precipitation is calculated using a nonlinear
relationship between precipitation and ground-surface elevation.
Parameters for the equation below can be estimated by fitting the
equation to observed precipitation for a range of elevations. The
relationship is defined as follows:

.. math:: Precipitation = \left\lbrack A\ + B\ *\ z^{c}\ \right\rbrack

where

.. math:: A = intercept\ \left\lbrack L/T \right\rbrack 

.. math:: B = constant\ \left\lbrack L^{- c} \right\rbrack

.. math:: c = nonlinear\ scaling\ factor\ \left\lbrack - \right\rbrack

.. math:: z = Elevation\ \left\lbrack L \right\rbrack

To activate this option, select the “\ *Elevation*\ ” tab and check the
box next to the elevation-based precipitation equation and define the
required parameters in the now active dialog boxes (Figure 7.41). Below
the area where the parameters for the elevation-based recharge equation
are defined is a window where elevation factors can be defined. These
factors can be used to specify the percentage of total precipitation,
calculated by the elevation-based precipitation equation above, that
will be applied as recharge to the aquifer for a specific elevation
band. For example, consider two different elements with average
elevations of 800 and 1,500 m and calculated precipitations of 25 and 80
centimeters per year (cm/yr), respectively. Supposing that two elevation
factors were defined as displayed in Figure 7.41, then recharge for the
first and second elements would be 8.75 and 60 cm/yr, respectively. The
following equation shows how these recharge values are calculated.

Recharge calculated using elevation factors:

.. math:: Recharge\  = P\ * EF\ = \left\lbrack ( A\ + B\ * z^{c}\ ) * EF\ \right\rbrack

where

.. math:: P = precipitation\ \left\lbrack \frac{L}{T} \right\rbrack

.. math:: EF = Elevation\ Factor\ \left\lbrack - \right\rbrack

.. figure:: media/figure_7_41_manual.png
   :width: 5.70442in
   :height: 3.62308in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.41 Defining parameters for elevation-based recharge

Temporal factors can also be applied to precipitation calculated via the
elevation-based precipitation equation. Temporal factors can be applied
in addition to ground-surface elevation factors. To define temporal
factors, first activate the elevation-based precipitation equation on
the *“Elevation”* tab, define the necessary parameters, and, if desired,
define elevation factors. Next, select the *“Temporal”* tab and create
the temporal factors. Temporal factors are defined similarly to
temporally varying recharge, as described at the beginning of Section
7.4.1. The options for temporal factors are *“Constant,” “Annual,”* and
*“Varied.”* For illustration purposes, suppose that recharge to an
aquifer during winter is reduced because precipitation falls as snow and
sublimates rather than melting and infiltrating. In order to account for
this phenomenon in the model, the user could define temporal factors to
reduce recharge during the winter months. Figure 7.42 shows an example
of how the user might define these annually repeating temporal factors.
For January and February, the recharge to the aquifer is 25% of what is
calculated by the elevation-based precipitation equation, whereas for
March, April, and May, it is 50% of precipitation. For summer months and
into fall, recharge is 100% of precipitation, and, finally, for late
fall into early winter, recharge is 75% of calculated precipitation. If
elevation factors are also defined, then recharge will first be adjusted
by the appropriate elevation factor and then by the temporal factor. The
following equations show how recharge is calculated using only temporal
factors as well as temporal factors with elevation factors.

Recharge calculated using temporal factors:

.. math:: Recharge\  = P*TF = \left\lbrack ( A\ + B\ *\ z^{c}\ ) *\ TF\ \right\rbrack

where

.. math:: TF = Temporal\ Factor\ \left\lbrack - \right\rbrack

Recharge calculated using elevation and temporal factors:

.. math:: Recharge\  = P\ *\ EF\ *\ TF\ = \left\lbrack (( A\ + B * z^{c}\ ) * EF\ ) * TF\ \right\rbrack

As previously noted, the values defined in the time series section of
the *“Temporal”* tab of the *“Recharge”* dialog box represent scaling
factors if the elevation function is activated. If the elevation
function is not used, then these values will be used by the model as
precipitation rates.

   :height: 3.62308in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.42 Defining temporal factors for elevation-based recharge

If the “\ *Recharge will be applied to first wet layer*\ ” box is
checked, then recharge is applied directly to the first wet layer;
otherwise, it is applied to the top layer.

The required information for recharge zones is described below.

Zone: 
	Number of recharge zones. Two options are available: constant
	(recharge is simulated constant over time) and time varied (recharge is
	simulated variable over time).

Date: 
	Time.

Rate: 
	Recharge rate (millimeters per day [mm/day] or feet per year [ft/yr]).

To assign the created recharge zones, add a *“2-D Plane”* plot item to
the View Pane and select “\ *Recharge”* as the “\ *Color By”* option.
Click the *“Select”* tool in the “\ *Tool Bar”* and then select the
elements where the first recharge zone is to be assigned. Press [Enter]
when the selection is complete, and select the appropriate recharge zone
in the drop-down list and click *“OK”* to complete the assignment.
Repeat these steps until all the zones have been assigned.

7.4.7 Evaporation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *Evaporation*\ ” boundary condition is used to simulate the
discharge of groundwater from a shallow water table due to
evapotranspiration from vegetated areas or evaporation from a bare-soil
area. In this option, the evapotranspiration rate depends on the local
depth to the water table, the extinction depth, the potential
evapotranspiration rate, and the size of the evaporation zone. The
simulation assumes that discharge is linearly related to the depth from
just below the ground surface down to the water table. The linear
relation holds until a maximum depth is reached; this is the extinction
depth. At the extinction depth, evapotranspiration (or evaporation)
ceases, and its value is zero for any depth greater than the extinction
depth.

When “\ *Evaporation*\ ” is selected from the “\ *BCs*\ ” drop-down menu
on the Main Menu banner found at the top of the screen, the dialog box
shown in Figure 7.43 appears. The required information for evaporation
zones is described below. Similar to recharge zones, evaporation
parameters must be defined prior to applying them to the model.

.. figure:: media/figure_7_43_manual.png
   :width: 6.00000in
   :height: 3.28333in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.43 The “\ *Define Evaporation Zones*\ ” dialog box

Depth to Zero ET: 
	Extinction depth (depth below which there is zero
	evapotranspiration).

Maximum ET Rate: 
	Maximum evapotranspiration rate (m/yr or ft/yr).

Multiplier of ETMAX: 
	ETMAX is defined as the maximum
	evapotranspiration rate. This defines the multiplication factor of
	maximum evaporation for the time step. The multiplier of ETMAX can be
	defined as time-series data. The three options are constant, annual, and
	varied. Each is explained in the time-series data section (Section
	7.4.1).

After defining the evapotranspiration zones, the plot item “\ *2-D
Plane*\ ” should be selected from the list provided in the “\ *Control
Panel.*\ ” In the “\ *Color By*\ ” attribute, select “\ *Evaporation*.”
Now, using the “\ *Select*\ ” tool (see Chapter 6), elements can be
selected and the newly created evaporation zones can be applied to the
elements.

7.5 Initial Conditions
----------------------

To solve the groundwater flow equation, **MINEDW** requires an initial
estimate for the head values (initial conditions). The initial
conditions can be specified by either defining a constant-head value or
reading varied head data from a file created in a previous model run.

To define the initial conditions, select “\ *Initial Heads*\ ” from the
“\ *Project*\ ” drop-down menu on the Main Menu banner found at the top
of the screen, and the dialog box shown in Figure 7.44 appears.

.. figure:: media/figure_7_44_manual.png
   :width: 3.24809in
   :height: 1.43750in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.44 The “\ *Set Up Initial Head*\ ” dialog box

Constant: 
	The initial head for all the nodes is a constant value,
	which is input in the field provided.

Varied: 
	The initial head for all the nodes is imported from a file
	created by a previous model run. **MINEDW** records the groundwater
	head for the entire model domain at the last time step of a model run in
	an .MDL file. This is done for both steady-state and transient model
	simulations. To use this information as the initial condition for a
	subsequent model run, click on “\ *Varied*\ ” and then the *“…”* button
	to the right. Select the .MDL file from the folder where **MINEDW**
	previously ran (it must be the same model domain). The format of the
	.MDL file is 10 columns of head data. The length of the file will vary
	with the size of the model, but the head value corresponds to the nodes
	in the model beginning with the first node and ending with the last
	node, reading from left to right and top to bottom.

7.6 Mining Plan
---------------

**MINEDW** can simulate the progressive excavation of an open-pit
mine. The simulation of open-pit excavation is performed by collapsing
the elements (i.e., changing the *z* coordinates of nodes) in the
finite-element mesh. The shape of the excavation is defined by the mine
plan, usually provided as a 3-D .DXF file, and the excavation of the
mine over time is simulated by interpolating between known pit
geometries. There are two spatial interpolation options that can be used
to calculate the new *z* coordinates of nodes as they are moved over
time; these are explained in Section 7.6.1. The way in which the
open-pit mine is excavated is based on either depth or volume, which is
explained in the following paragraphs. Within the pit extent, a finer
mesh area improves the accuracy of the simulated seepage face and
pore-pressure distributions behind the pit wall.

To create a mining plan, select the “\ *Mining*\ ” drop-down menu and
then the “\ *Create Mining Plan*\ ” function (Figure 7.45).

.. figure:: media/figure_7_45_manual.png
   :width: 2.34306in

   :align: center

   Figure 7.45 The “\ *Mining*\ ” drop-down menu

As described, the shape of the open pit is defined by XYZ data that may
be provided as 3-D .DXF files by the mine for specific points in time.
To simulate the excavation of the open pit between these known
geometries, **MINEDW** provides two methods: depth and volume.
Depth-based excavation simultaneously moves the pit surface outward in
all directions, as shown in Figure 7.46. This is done by calculating the
distance between two known open-pit geometries and dividing the distance
by the number of time steps between the two dates associated with the
geometries.

   :width: 6.00000in
   :height: 2.23934in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.46 Pit geometry when using “\ *Depth*\ ”-based excavation

Volume-defined excavation will move the pit surface downward, rather
than outward, toward the next known pit geometry, as shown in Figure
7.47. This is done by calculating the total volume to be excavated
between two known geometries and dividing the volume by the number of
time steps between the two dates associated with the geometries. This
rate defines the volume of material excavated for each time step.

The *“Create Mining Plan…”* function will allow the user to combine both
excavation methods when creating a mining plan only if open-pit
geometries are provided.

7.6.1 Creating a Mining Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**MINEDW** provides the user with two options for entering the
mine-plan information, which is used to create the mining-plan file used
to simulate progressive excavation of an open pit. The first option is
to provide XYZ data of the open pit over time in .DAT files (Section
7.6.1.2.). The second option is to provide XYZ data of the pit at the
end of mining (ultimate pit) and pit-bottom elevations through time
(Section 7.6.1.3).

If the XYZ data for pit topography is provided in 3-D .DXF files, they
will need to be converted into .DAT file format before they are used to
create a mining plan. The *Rhino* “\ *Drop*\ ” function can be used to
achieve this or any other program that is capable of manipulating .DXF
files. Alternatively, **MINEDW** provides a function that can be used
to convert .DXF files to .DAT file format (Section 7.6.1.1).

To create a mining plan, from the Main Menu banner click “\ *Mining,*\ ”
then select “\ *Create Mining Plan.*\ ” The “\ *Create Mining Plan*\ ”
dialog box shown in Figure 7.48 appears.

.. figure:: media/figure_7_48_manual.png

	The file path to the location where input files
	are located must be entered here. Two options are available: manual
	entry, or by clicking the *“…”* button, which opens the “\ *Select
	Directory”* dialog box. The "*Select Directory*" dialog box can be used
	to navigate to where the input files reside.

Start Date: 
	Define the start date of the mining stage.

End Date: 
	Define the end date of the mining stage. Periods of no
	excavation between mining stages can be created simply by ensuring that
	the start date of the next mining stage does not correspond with the end
	date of the previous stage. The mining periods for each of the stages,
	however, cannot overlap.

Ultimate-Pit Outline File: 
	Enter pit boundary file name. This file is
	required to be in a .BLN format.

Add: 
	Add additional records to be used in the mining plan.

Insert: 
	Insert additional records to be used in the mining plan.

Delete: 
	Delete records used in the mining plan.

Open: 
	Open a mining-schedule file that contains a list of records to
	be used in a mining plan. The file format for a mining-schedule file is
	described in Appendix B.

Save: 
	Save a mine plan file. This will save the records of the mining
	plan to a file that can be imported again with the “\ *Open*\ ” option.

Options: 
	Menu defining mining-plan spatial-interpolation options.
	**MINEDW** uses inverse distance weighting or kriging interpolation
	methods to create the progressive excavation of the open pit from data
	files that are provided by the user. The interpolation methods can be
	changed in the options menu of the “\ *Create Mining Plan*\ ” menu. The
	options menu is displayed in Figure 7.49 below.

	Option to determine which elevation is valid if
	two elevations exist at one point in one .DAT file. The user can either
	keep the minimum elevation, maximum elevation, or an average of the
	elevations.

7.6.1.1 Converting .DXF to .DAT files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any .DXF file that will be used to create a mine plan needs to be
converted to an XYZ data file (.DAT). To do so, on the “\ *List*\ ” tab,
double-click “\ *File Data,*\ ” then double-click “\ *DXF*.” The
“\ *Attributes*\ ” tab appears. Select the “\ **+**\ ” next to the
“\ *File*\ ” attribute as shown in the green box in Figure 7.50, and the
*“Select DXF data file”* dialog box opens. Navigate to the location of
the desired .DXF file, select it, and click “\ *Open.”* Next, select the
icon next to “\ *To Data File*\ ” to save the information from the .DXF
file as a .DAT file. Repeat the same procedure for all mining .DXF files
that are to be used in the mine plan. For .DXF files that have multiple
layers, the user may choose the layers that will be used for the mine
plan by activating or deactivating the layers using the “\ *Layers*\ ”
attribute.

   Figure 7.50 Reading a .DXF file and saving as a data file

For any pit plan that is created in **MINEDW**, a pit outline is
needed (e.g., the ultimate-pit boundary) to define the nodes that will
be used for interpolation. This boundary needs to be defined using a
.BLN file format and is always the first record in the mine plan file.
This file defines the perimeter of the pit and does not contain
elevation information because all elevations are assumed to be the top
of the mesh.

Note: All of the .DAT files that are used to create the mining plan file
must be located in the same directory.

7.6.1.2 Creating a Mining Plan from Pit Topography files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is a guide to creating a mining plan and schedule based on
XYZ data of pit topography stored in .DAT files.

From the Main Menu, click “\ *Mining,*\ ” and then select “\ *Create
Mining Plan.*\ ” Enter the file path to where the pit topography files
(.DAT file format) are located in the “\ *Input Data Directory”* box.
Enter the name of the ultimate-pit boundary file in the *“Ultimate Pit
Outline File”* box. Next, click “\ *Add*\ ” to add a record to the
“\ *Create Mining Plan*\ ” dialog box for each of the pit topography
files. For each of the pit topography files, enter the file name and the
corresponding start and end date, and choose *“Depth”* or *“Volume”*
under *“Interpolated With.”* Next, enter a name for the new mining plan
file in the “\ *Created Mining Plan File Name*\ ” box or, to select a
different directory than the directory where the mining files are
located, click the button next to the data entry box and select the
desired file location and enter a file name (Figure 7.51).

Alternatively, the data detailed in the above steps can be imported from
a “\ *Mine Plan File*.” If a “\ *Mine Plan File”* is available, click
*“Open…”* in the “\ *Create Mining Plan”* dialog box and navigate to the
location of the “\ *Mine Plan File.”* Select it and then click
“\ *Open.”* The directory path, mining start date, ultimate-pit boundary
file name, pit-geometry files, and associated dates will be populated.
The default for *“Interpolated With”* is *“Depth.”* If the *“Volume”*
method is desired, then be sure to select it for the appropriate mining
stages. Finally, enter a name for the new mining plan file in the
“\ *Created Mining Plan File Name*\ ” box or, to select a different
directory than the directory where the mining files are located, click
the button next to the data entry box and select the desired file
location and enter a file name.

mining file. The file will need to be imported into the model using the
*“Open Pit…”* menu, which is discussed in more detail in Section 7.6.2.

7.6.1.3 Creating a Mining Plan from Final-Pit Topography
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the Main Menu banner, click “\ *Mining,*\ ” and then select
“\ *Create Mining Plan.*\ ” Next, enter the name of the ultimate-pit
boundary file in the box next to “\ *Ultimate Pit Outline File.”* Click
“\ *Add*\ ” to add a record to the “\ *Create Mining Plan*\ ” dialog box
and enter the name of the .DAT file containing the ultimate-pit
topography. Enter the appropriate start and end date and file name under
“\ *Date*\ ” and “\ *File*,” respectively, for the ultimate pit.

Click “\ *Insert*\ ” to add records above the previously created record.
For these newly created records, enter the pit-bottom elevation and the
start and end date in the “\ *File/Elevation,*\ ” “\ *Start Date,”* and
“\ *End Date*\ ” columns (Figure 7.52).

7.6.2 Importing a Mine Plan into MINEDW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After creating the mine plan, select “\ *Open Pit*\ ” in the
“\ *Mining*\ ” drop-down menu to assign the mining file to the model.
After the “\ *Open Pit*\ ” dialog box opens (Figure 7.53), click
“\ *Add*\ ” and browse to the mining plan file; select it and click
“\ *Open*\ ” in the “\ *Open Mining Plan File*\ ” dialog box.

   Figure 7.53 The “\ *Open Pit*\ ” dialog box

For each pit, there are four different menus: 1) “\ *General,*\ ” 2)
“\ *Pit Lake,*\ ” 3) “\ *ZOR,*\ ” and 4) “\ *Backfilling.*\ ” Under the
general tab, pit-plan information is provided, including the pit name,
the start and end dates, and the pit-bottom elevations. In this menu,
the user can open a different mining file using the “\ *Replace with*\ ”
command or create a different mining plan using the “\ *Create*\ ”
command. Under the other three tabs, a pit lake (Section 7.6.3), a zone
of relaxation (ZOR) (Section 7.6.4), and backfilling (Section 7.6.5) can
be defined.

Once a mining plan has been imported into **MINEDW**, the user may
visualize the open-pit excavation through time by selecting the
“\ *List*\ ” tab in the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane on the right-hand
side of the Main Menu and adding a “\ *3-D Element*\ ” plot item. The
mesh will be displayed in the View Pane in plan view with geological
units. To view pit excavation at a particular time step, enter the
time-step number in the box on the time-step slider; otherwise, click on
the time-step slider (Figure 7.54) and move it to the right to view the
progressive excavation of the pit through time.

7.6.3 Pit Lake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When mine operations cease, a pit lake can form if the pit bottom is
below the pre-mining water table. To simulate the pit-lake formation in
**MINEDW**, select “\ *Open Pit*\ ” from the “\ *Mining*\ ” drop-down
menu. In the “\ *Open Pit*\ ” dialog box (Figure 7.56), select the pit
plan that a pit lake forms under, and then select the “\ *Pit Lake*\ ”
tab and check the box next to “\ *Activate*.” To define a pit-lake
simulation, enter a date in the “\ *Start Date*\ ” box for the start of
the pit-lake formation, an “\ *Initial Lake Elevation,*\ ”
“\ *Evaporation*\ ” rate (if any), and the *“# of Stages*\ ” in the
lake. These options are described in more detail below.

   :align: center

   Figure 7.56 The “\ *Pit Lake*\ ” tab

The following are options are available in the *“Pit Lake”* tab:

Start Date: 
	Date of when pit-lake infilling will begin. This date must
	be after mining has ended and equal to or later than the backfilling
	date if backfilling is applied.

Initial Lake Elevation: 
	This value must be equal to or greater than
	the minimum pit elevation or the pit bottom after backfilling
	operations. In the case of a sump or area of the pit that already holds
	water at the start of pit-lake formation, you would enter an “\ *Initial
	Lake Elevation*\ ” greater than the pit bottom.

Evaporation: 
	Evaporation rate of the pit lake (millimeters per year
	[mm/yr] or ft/yr).

# of Stages: 
	Number of stages to be used in the simulation. The user
	must specify the “\ *Elevation”* of each stage in the dialog box below
	the input for the number of stages. ***MINEDW*** will calculate the
	*“Area”* and “\ *Volume”* of the stages.

Create: 
	The *“Create”* function will automatically calculate the area
	and volume of each stage based on the *“# of Stages”* the user selects.

Import: 
	Using the *“Import”* function, the user can import a pit-lake
	file.

Additional Pump/Recharge: 
	Switch for additional sources of discharge
	(-) or recharge (+) (excluding groundwater seepage) when the elevation
	is lower than a user-specified elevation. When the pit-lake recharge
	option is activated, click the “\ *Define* *Rate*\ ” button and a new
	menu (Figure 7.57) will appear. In this menu, the user can define any
	additional recharge and pumping to/from a pit lake based on time-series
	data.

7.6.4 Zone of Relaxation for Pit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


In **MINEDW**, a ZOR can be created around excavations, backfilling
operations, longwall coal mining, room-and-pillar coal mining,
freeze-thaw conditions, or other scenarios in which hydraulic
conductivity may change during the simulation period.

To create a ZOR for an open pit, select “\ *Open Pit*\ ” from the
“\ *Mining*\ ” drop-down menu. Select the open-pit plan from the
drop-down box on the upper left-hand corner of the dialog box and then
select the “\ *ZOR*\ ” tab (Figure 7.58).

.. figure:: media/figure_7_58_manual.png
   :width: 5.04624in
   :height: 4.44298in
   :align: center

   Figure 7.58 The “\ *Open Pit*\ ” dialog box with “\ *ZOR*\ ” active

**MINEDW** offers two options for specifying the thickness and shape
of the ZOR: as a ratio of the pit depth or by user-defined thicknesses.

Using the first option, the user can further subdivide the ZOR into
layers that are also defined using a thickness that is calculated as a
ratio of the pit depth. This results in a ZOR that has a minimum
thickness at the perimeter of the pit and thickens toward the center of
the pit (Figure 7.59). Layering within the ZOR is defined in percentages
of the total ZOR. The sum of user-defined percentages must be less than
or equal to 100. In either case, **MINEDW** will add a layer such that
the “\ *ZOR Definition*\ ” dialog box will always contain *n* + 1 ZOR
layers (where *n* is the number defined by the user) (Figure 7.58). The
input file created by **MINEDW** will always contain *n* + 1 layers,
but the layer added by **MINEDW** will only be used if the
user-defined percentages are less than 100. For example, in a 120-m deep
pit with a ZOR thickness equal to ¼ of the pit depth, the ZOR will have
a maximum thickness of 30 m. The ZOR can then be divided into two equal
layers by entering “2” in the box next to “\ *# of Additional ZOR
Layers”* and then entering “50%” for both layers. When *“Search Zone”*
is clicked, **MINEDW** adds an additional layer for a total of three
ZOR layers, as displayed in Figure 7.59a. The ZOR layers that are used
in the simulation are “\ *Layer#1”* and *“Layer#2.”* The layer added by
**MINEDW**, “\ *Layer#3,”* is not used\ *.* Alternatively, the ZOR
could have been created by creating one ZOR layer, entering “50%” for
the layer, and then clicking “\ *Search Zone.”* In this scenario, the
layer created by **MINED*** is used and accounts for the remaining 50%
of the ZOR (Figure 7.59b). Also, it is important to remember that, when
**MINEDW** searches for geological units within the ZOR, it displays
all the units for each layer even though the unit may not form part of
the ZOR. For example, if the model contains a surficial unit such as
alluvium that does not form part of the ZOR, it will be shown in the ZOR
dialog window but can be excluded by using a factor of 1 for the
hydraulic conductivity multiplier.

   Figure 7.59 Defining the ZOR. A) Default layer is inactive, B) Default
   layer is active

Using option two, in which the user defines the absolute thickness, the
user specifies the number of layers in the ZOR and the thickness (m or
ft) of each layer. The sum of these layers will be the ZOR thickness no
matter the pit depth, as shown in Figure 7.60.

   Figure 7.60 Defining the ZOR thickness using absolute thickness layers.

To create a ZOR using option one, click the “\ *ZOR thickness = 1/ of
Pit Depth*\ ” checkbox to activate the ZOR thickness proportionality
option and then choose an appropriate ratio. Next, define the number of
layers to use in the ZOR using the toggle buttons next to the “\ *# of
Additional ZOR Layers”* box or by typing in a number. After that,
specify the thickness as a percentage for each ZOR layer, keeping in
mind that the cumulative sum of percentages must not exceed 100.
**MINEDW** will provide the user a warning if the cumulative sum is
greater than 100%. Layers are ordered from top down, where the top layer
forms around the pit surface. Once layer percentages are defined, click
the “\ *Search ZOR Units*\ ” button and **MINEDW** finds the
geological zones that lie within the defined ZOR. The “\ *ZOR
Definition*\ ” box, at the right (Figure 7.58), will contain the
results.

To create a ZOR using option two, define the number of layers to use and
the thickness of each layer, then click *“Search ZOR Units.”*

For either method, factors of the original hydraulic conductivity values
are entered in the columns labeled “\ *Layer#1*,” “\ *Layer#2*,” etc.
After finishing, click “\ *Create ZOR*\ ” to create the ZOR for the open
pit and then check the box next to “\ *Activate*\ ” at the top left of
the “\ *Open Pit*\ ” dialog box. Click “\ *OK*\ ” to save the changes
and close the “\ *Open Pit*\ ” dialog box.

Once a ZOR has been created, it can be visualized by selecting the
“\ *List*\ ” tab in the “\ *Control* *Panel*\ ” Pane on the right-hand
side of the Main Menu banner. Expand the “\ *Element*\ ” item and
double-click “\ *Time Varied Conductivity*\ ” (Figure 7.61).

If the mining plan is modified or replaced with a different mining plan,
the ZOR will need to be recreated.

7.6.5 Open-Pit Backfilling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**MINEDW** can simulate open-pit backfilling. Backfilling may be used
in some mining applications to prevent the formation of a pit lake or to
dispose of tailings after mining has ceased. To use this option, select
“\ *Open Pit*\ ” from the “\ *Mining*\ ” drop-down menu. Select the
desired pit plan on the left and then click the “\ *Backfilling*\ ” tab
(Figure 7.62). Check the “\ *Activate*\ ” box and define the
“\ *Implement Date*\ ” for backfilling. The “\ *Implement Date*\ ” of
backfilling must be before or the same time as the “\ *Start Date*\ ” of
pit-lake formation. **MINEDW** does not support the backfilling of an
existing pit lake and automatically adjusts the “\ *Start Date*\ ” or
“\ *Implement Date*\ ” for pit-lake or backfilling operations to prevent
backfilling of a pit lake. Backfilling operations are simulated in one
time step rather than progressive backfilling over multiple time steps.
The backfill elevation can be defined as constant by checking the
“\ *Constant Elevation*\ ” option and entering a value. Otherwise, if
more detailed information is available for the backfill, “\ *Varied*\ ”
can be checked and the file containing elevation information, in .DAT
file format, can be selected in the “\ *Open Data File*\ ” dialog box
that opens. In the “\ *Grid*\ ” dialog box, choose the interpolation
method and enter the appropriate parameters. The surface for the
backfill is then created. Finally, the hydraulic parameters for the
backfill can be selected from the drop-down list (Figure 7.62). The
entire backfilled zone will have the same hydraulic properties and
cannot be subdivided. When the “\ *Backfilling*\ ” parameters are
completely defined, click “\ *OK*\ ” in the “\ *Open Pit*\ ” dialog box
to ensure that the changes are saved.

7.6.5 Zone of Relaxation for Caving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In **MINEDW**, the time-varied hydraulic conductivity related to the
displacement of rock caused by underground mining can be simulated.

To create this hydrogeologic zone, select “\ *Zone of Relaxation for
Caving*\ ” from the “\ *Mining*\ ” menu on the Main Menu banner. The
“\ *Create Zone of Relaxation for Cave Zone*\ ” dialog box appears
(Figure 7.63). Information required for creating this hydrogeologic zone
is described below.

   Figure 7.63 The “\ *Create Zone of Relaxation for Cave Zone*\ ” dialog
   box

Mining Schedule: 
	The spatial extent of displaced rock over time due to
	block caving, which includes the date when the mining phase begins and
	the file names of 3-D .DXF files delimiting the extent of the inner and
	outer ZOR layers for the mining phase.

ZOR Definition: 
	The factors by which hydraulic conductivity
	increases/decreases for each hydrogeologic zone that is displaced by
	caving.

Date and file name information can be entered manually in the *“Mining
Schedule”* window or automatically using a mining schedule file. If
*“Mining Schedule”* information is to be entered manually, enter the
date when the first mining phase will begin and then enter the file name
of the .DXF file defining the inner ZOR layer in the column labeled
*“Layer #1 File.”* Next, enter the file name of the file defining the
outer ZOR layer in the column labeled *“Layer #2 File.”* Click “\ *Add”*
on the top right of the dialog box to add a new entry, and repeat the
steps described above until the ZOR for caving is completely defined. To
use a mining schedule file to enter information into the *“Mining
Schedule,”* click *“Open…”* and locate the mining schedule file. Select
it and then click *“Open”* in the *“Open Caving ZOR File”* dialog box.
Note that **MINEDW** only supports two ZOR layers for caving, unlike
the option for open pits, in which the user can define as many ZOR
layers as desired.

After entering the necessary data, click “\ *Search Zone*.” The relevant
hydrogeologic zone appears. Enter the factors by which hydraulic
conductivity will change for each ZOR layer under the columns labeled
“\ *Layer #1”* and *“Layer #2.”*

Enter the file name of the cave-zone ZOR file to be created in the box
at the bottom of the “\ *Create Zone of Relaxation for Cave Zone*\ ”
dialog box and then click “\ *OK*.” To assign the created time-varied
conductivity file for a cave zone to the model, please see the following
section.

7.6.6 Dewatering and Underground Mining
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *Dewatering and Underground Mining*\ ” menu is used to assign the
underground ZOR mining file to the model and to define groundwater
recovery in the mined area at the end of mining. The drop-down box at
the top of the dialog box contains a list of underground mines already
defined (this list may be blank if none have been defined). The *“Add”*
and “\ *Delete”* buttons to the right of the drop-down box are used to
add or delete mines from the model. The “\ *Dewatering and Underground
Mining*\ ” dialog box is divided into three tabs: 1) \ *“General,” 2)
“ZOR,”* and 3) *“Recover”* (Figure 7.64), which are explained below.
