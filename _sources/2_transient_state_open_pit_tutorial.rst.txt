Tutorial 2 - Open Pit Mining
============================

2.1 Problem Description
-----------------------

Tutorial 2 demonstrates the setup of a transient-state simulation
including an open pit, a ZOR, pumping wells, and a pit lake.

Tutorial 2 uses the same model as Tutorial 1. The simulation results
from the steady-state simulation (Tutorial 1) are used as the initial
conditions for Tutorial 2. In this part of the document, the procedure
for creating a mining plan, ZOR, pit lake, and variable-flux boundaries
will be discussed step by step.

Step 1. Opening the Project File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The model created in Tutorial 1 is used for this problem. To open the
project file created in the first tutorial, click “\ *File*\ ” on the
Main Menu banner, then select “\ *Open Project.*\ ” The “\ *Load a
MINEDW Project File*\ ” dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2.1.

Select the project (.PRJ) file and click “\ *Open.*\ ” Click
“\ *File*\ ” on the Main Menu banner, then select “\ *Save Project
As*\ ” to save the project as a different .PRJ file for the transient
simulation.

Step 2. Defining Project Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To define a project property, click “\ *Project*\ ” and then select
“\ *Project Property*.” The “\ *Project Properties*\ ” dialog box shown
in Figure 2.2 appears. Make sure that all the fields shown in Figure 2.2
contain the values shown in Figure 2.2. For transient simulations,
select the “\ *Transient*\ ” option and then click “\ *OK.*\ ”

Step 3. Defining Model Time Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To define the time steps for the project, click “\ *Project*\ ” on the
Main Menu banner, then select “\ *Time Steps.*\ ” The “\ *Set Up Time
Step*\ ” dialog box (Figure 2.3) appears. Set the “\ *Maximum* *Time
Steps*\ ” to 300. The first time step is 1 January 1995. The time-step
length will be one month. For transient simulations, the multiplication
factor (as discussed in Tutorial 1) is 1 and the time-step length is
defined in the “\ *Set Up Time Step*\ ” dialog box. Ensure that the *“#
of time steps for this simulation*\ ” slider is set to 300 and that the
“\ *Start at Time Step*\ ” combo box is set to 1 and click “\ *OK.”*

Step 3. Defining Initial Heads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To define initial heads, click “\ *Project*\ ” on the Main Menu banner,
then select “\ *Initial Heads.*\ ” The “\ *Set Up Initial Head*\ ”
dialog box appears. Choose the “\ *Varied*\ ” option and select the
water levels file (“\*.MDL”) created during Tutorial 1 by clicking on
the “…” button as shown in Figure 2.4, then click “\ *OK.*\ ”

Step 4. Creating a Mining Plan for an Open Pit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest method to create a mine plan in **MINEDW** is to obtain
.DXF files of the pit topography at various points in time (e.g., at the
end of every year of mining). Each .DXF file will need to be converted
to a data file containing X, Y, Z coordinates of the pit surface for
interpolation of the mine plan to a mining input file for **MINEDW**.
In this example, there are 11 years of mining. .DXF files of the planned
pit shape at the end of each year of mining are found in the
“\ *INPUT/OPENPIT*\ ” file directory.

On the “\ *List*\ ” tab, double-click on “\ *File data,*\ ” then
double-click on “\ *DXF*.” The “\ *Attributes*\ ” tab will appear. To
select the .DXF file for Year 1, select the “+” next to “\ *File*\ ” as
shown in the red box in Figure 2.5, browse to the file, select it, and
click “\ *Open*.” Next. select the icon next to “\ *To Data File*\ ” at
the bottom of the “\ *Attributes*\ ” tab to save the information from
the .DXF file as a data (“\*.DAT”) file. Be sure to use the same file
name as the .DXF file to name the “\*.DAT” file; otherwise, the next
step will not work. Repeat these steps for the next 10 years of mining.

For any mining plan that is created in **MINEDW**, a pit footprint is
required (e.g., the ultimate pit boundary) to define the nodes that will
be used for interpolation. This boundary needs to be defined in a .BLN
file format (Appendix B). This boundary is always the first record in
any mining schedule when creating an open-pit mining plan. This file
defines the perimeter of the open pit and does not contain
ground-surface elevation information because all ground-surface
elevations are assumed to be the top of the mesh.

   Figure 2.5 Reading a .DXF file and saving as a data file

To create the mining plan, on the Main Menu banner, click
“\ *Mining,*\ ” then select “\ *Create Mining Plan*.” The “\ *Create
Mining Plan*\ ” dialog box (Figure 2.6) appears. The date, file name,
and interpolation method can be entered manually by typing in the
information under “\ *Date,” “File/Elevation,”* and “\ *Interpolated
With,”* respectively. Another option is to select an input file known as
a Mining Schedule file (Appendix B) containing this information. Itasca
has created a Mining Schedule file to illustrate this process. To use
it, select the “\ *Open*\ ” button and select the file
“\ *INPUT/OPENPIT/MINE\_SCHEDULE.DAT*.” This file contains the dates and
file names, as shown in Figure 2.6. After importing the mine plan file
information, enter a file name for the new mining plan file in the
“\ *Created Mining Plan File Name*:” box (for example,
“\ *MINE\_FILE.DAT*\ ”) at the bottom of the “\ *Create Mining Plan*\ ”
dialog box (Figure 2.6). In order to create a mining file, all input
mining files must be located in the same directory (in this example, the
files “\ *MINE\_SCHEDULE.DAT*,” “\ *ULTIMATE.BLN,*\ ” “\ *YEAR1.DAT*,”
“\ *YEAR2.DAT*,” etc. were moved from “\ *INPUT/OPENPIT*\ ” to the main
simulation directory). Next, click the *“Options…”* button to open the
*“Mining Plan Interpolation”* dialog box. Uncheck the box next to *“Not
interpolated if no data found in Rang.”* This will exclude locations
that do not have associated elevation data. Click *“OK”* on the *“Mining
Plan Interpolation”* dialog box to accept the changes and then click
“\ *OK*\ ” on the *“Create Mining Plan”* dialog box to create the mining
plan file for the **MINEDW** model.

To assign a mining file to the model, click “\ *Mining*\ ” on the Main
Menu banner and select “\ *Open Pit.*\ ” The “\ *Open Pit*\ ” dialog box
appears (Figure 2.7).

   Figure 2.7 The “\ *Open Pit*\ ” dialog box

Click “\ *Add”* and browse to the newly created mining file, select it,
and click “\ *Open.”* After importing the mining file, the *“General”*
tab in the *“Open Pit”* dialog box will show the *“Start Date”* and
*“End Date”* for mining as well as the *“Pit-Bottom Elevation*.” This
tab will also indicate whether a *“Pit Lake,”* *“ZOR,”* or
“\ *Backfilling”* will be simulated. Immediately after importing the
mining file, these options should indicate that none will be simulated.
Steps 5 through 7 describe how to add these features to a model
simulation after creating and importing a mine plan. No additional
open-pit mines will be simulated in this tutorial, but if required,
multiple open-pit mines can be added to the model for simulation by
repeating the steps described above for creating and importing mining
files.

   tab

Step 5. Creating a Zone of Relaxation for an Open Pit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In **MINEDW**, time-variant hydraulic conductivity (*K*) can be
simulated for situations such as a ZOR around open-pit excavations,
backfilling operations, longwall and room-and-pillar coal mining, and
freeze-thaw conditions.

To create a ZOR for this open-pit simulation, select “\ *Open Pit…*\ ”
from the “\ *Mining*\ ” drop-down menu on the Main Menu banner. The
“\ *Open Pit*\ ” dialog box (Figure 2.8) appears. Select the “\ *ZOR”*
tab to create the ZOR. **MINEDW** offers two options for defining the
thickness of the ZOR: (1) As a ratio of the pit depth or (2) by a
user-defined thickness (both options are discussed in detail in Section
7.6.4 of the **MINEDW** manual). In this tutorial, the ZOR will be
defined as a ratio of the pit depth and divided into two layers. To
create the ZOR, check the box next to *“ZOR thickness = 1/”* and enter
“\ *3*\ ” as the denominator in the box. In the box next to “\ *# of
Additional ZOR Layers,”* ensure that the value is *“1.”* **MINEDW**
will add a default layer to the one layer defined by the user for a
total of two layers within the ZOR. Only the thickness of the first ZOR
layer needs to be defined because the remainder of the ZOR will
automatically be assigned to the default ZOR layer created by
**MINEDW**. The thickness of each layer is defined as a percentage of
the total ZOR thickness. In this tutorial, both ZOR layers will be equal
in thickness (i.e., each layer will be 50% of the ZOR) (see Figure
2.10).

.. figure:: media/figure_2_9_tutorial.png
   :width: 6.2in
   :height: 5.68in
   :align: center

   Figure 2.9 The “\ *Open Pit*\ ” dialog box showing the “\ *ZOR*\ ” tab

Next, click “\ *Search ZOR Unit,*\ ” located at the bottom of the dialog
box. The geological zones that lie within the defined ZOR will appear
(Figure 2.9). The numbers next to each geological unit represent the
factor by which the *K* in each ZOR layer will change. The default is 1,
or no change in *K* values. Numbers greater than 1 represent an increase
in the *K* values (i.e., to double the *K* values, enter “\ *2*\ ”),
while numbers less than 1 represent a decrease in the *K* values.

In this tutorial, the *K* values are 10 and 2 times greater than the
original *K* values. In the “\ *ZOR Definition*\ ” dialog box, enter
“\ *10*\ ” next to the units in *“Layer#1*\ ” except for the
“\ *Overburden*\ ” and “\ *Alluvium*\ ” zones, as they will be removed
prior to mining (leave as 1). See Figure 2.10 for more details about
assigning values to the second layer of the ZOR. After entering the
appropriate data in the “\ *ZOR*\ ” tab of the *“Open Pit”* dialog box,
click *“Create”* and then check the box next to *“Activate”* (this
option only becomes active after the ZOR has been correctly defined).
Finally, click “\ *OK*\ ” at the bottom of the dialog box to apply the
changes to the model and exit the “\ *Open Pit”* dialog box.

Once a ZOR has been created, it can be visualized by selecting the
“\ *List*\ ” tab in the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” pane and then selecting
the “\ *Time Varied Conductivity*\ ” plot item under the “\ *Element*\ ”
group (Figure 2.10). The ZOR that was created is shown in Figure 2.11.

Step 6. Open-Pit Backfilling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Backfilling may be used in some mining applications to prevent the
formation of a pit lake or to dispose of tailings after mining has
ceased. To add backfilling, select the *“Backfilling”* tab (Figure
2.12). Check the *“Activate”* box and define the *“Implement Date”* for
backfilling. The *“Implement Date”* of backfilling must be before the
*“Start Date”* of pit-lake formation. \ **MINEDW** does not support
the backfilling of an existing pit lake and will automatically adjust
the *“Start Date”* or *“Implement Date”* for pit-lake formation or
backfilling operations to prevent this. Backfilling operations are
simulated in one time step rather than progressive backfilling over
multiple time steps. The backfill elevation can be defined as constant
by checking the *“Constant Elevation”* option and entering a value.
Otherwise, if more detailed information is available for the backfill,
*“Varied”* can be selected. For this tutorial, check the *"Constant
Elevation"* radio button and enter the elevation of the final backfill
(Figure 2.12). Finally, the hydraulic parameters for the backfill can be
selected from the drop-down list labeled *“Backfill Unit”* (Figure
2.12). The entire backfilled zone will have the same hydraulic
properties and cannot be subdivided. When the *“Backfilling”* parameters
are completely defined, click *“OK”* in the *“Open Pit”* dialog box to
ensure the changes that were made are saved.

Step 7. Creating a Pit Lake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When mine operations and dewatering activities cease, a pit lake may
form if the pit-bottom elevation is below the recovering water-table
elevation. To simulate the pit-lake formation in **MINEDW**, select
“\ *Open Pit*\ ” from the *“Mining”* drop-down menu. In the “\ *Open
Pit*\ ” dialog box, ensure the *“MINE\_FILE”* plan is showing in the
drop-down box in the upper left-hand corner and then select the “\ *Pit
Lake”* tab (Figure 2.8)\ *.* Enter a date in the *“Start Date:”* box for
the start of the pit-lake formation. Next, enter a value for *“Initial
Lake Elevation.”* This value must be equal to or greater than the
ultimate pit-bottom elevation. In this tutorial, the open-pit *“Initial
Lake Elevation”* should be the minimum pit-bottom elevation of 450 m
(the bottom of the pit at the end of mining, Figure 2.8). If evaporation
from the pit-lake surface is to be considered, enter the evaporation
rate value in the *“Evaporation (mm/yr)”* box. For this model
simulation, evaporation is assigned a rate of 1,200 millimeters per year
(mm/yr). Enter the number of stages to use to calculate the pit-lake
volume in the “\ *# of Stages”* box. For this example, 15 stages (Figure
2.13) are used. Increasing the number of stages will give a more
accurate estimation of inflow to the open pit but may cause convergence
problems in the model simulation. As a rule of thumb, start with stages
that are approximately 50 m in depth; if greater accuracy is required,
increase the number of stages. Next, check the box next to *“Activate”*
and click “\ *OK*\ ” at the bottom of the dialog box to apply the
changes to the model and exit the “\ *Open Pit”* dialog box.

Step 8. Adding Pumping Wells
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pumping wells are extensively used in open-pit dewatering systems. In
**MINEDW**, there are three options available for pumping wells, all
of which are explained in detail in the **MINEDW** Manual section
7.4.4. Pumping wells can be defined in the model by defining pumping
rates, specified heads, or pumping rates with a lowest pumping elevation
(LPE).

“\ *Pumping Rate,*\ ” “\ *Pumping with LPE,*\ ” and “\ *Specified
Head*\ ” wells will be added in one step. During the calibration and
predictive simulations, it is important to use the correct type of
pumping well. “\ *Pumping Rate*\ ” and “\ *Pumping with LPE*\ ” are two
good choices for wells to use during calibration because the user can
assign actual pumping rates from the field to these wells in the model.
A “\ *Specified Head*\ ” well is useful for predictive simulations, as
it allows the user to specify the level to which they wish to lower the
phreatic surface without needing to manually adjust the pumping rate.

To add pumping wells to the model, from the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” pane,
select the “\ *List*\ ” tab, expand the “\ *Node*\ ” item, and then
double-click “\ *3D Contour.*\ ” Next, toggle to layer 27 using the
toggle buttons next to the “\ *Layer*\ ” attribute on the
“\ *Attributes”* tab (Figure 2.14). The layer where the pump is to be
simulated must be selected in order for the user to correctly construct
the pumping wells in the model. Nodes above the pumping wells are then
used to simulate the well screen.

   Figure 2.14 The “\ *Control Panel*\ ” pane with the
   “\ *Attributes*\ ” tab selected to show the correct layer 
   for pumping wells

In the **MINEDW** main window, click the “\ *Select*\ ” button on the
Main Menu banner. To locate the pumps in the model domain, use the pump
locations that were used to create the mesh. Add a *“Point Data File”*
plot item, which is found under the *“File Data”* item in the *“Control
Panel”* to the View Pane (Figure 2.15). Use the *“File”* attribute on
the *“Attributes”* tab to open the *“Select Data File”* dialog box. Use
the *“Select Data File”* dialog box to navigate to the location where
the input data for these tutorials are located and select the
*“Pumps.Dat”* file in the *“INPUT/MESH\_INPUT/DAT”* directory.

   Figure 2.15 The *“Point Data”* plot item

Select the nodes below the points now displayed in the View Pane and
then press [Enter]. In the *“Assign Properties for Nodes”* dialog box,
select the *“Add to Pumping Wells”* option (Figure 2.16), then click
*“OK.”* For this tutorial, the goal will be to dewater the open pit
during active mining using any combination of the three pumping well
types.

   showing the “\ *Add to Pumping Wells*\ ” option selected

Next, open the “\ *Pumping Well*\ ” dialog box by clicking on
“\ *BCs*\ ” on the Main Menu banner, then select “\ *Pumping Well.*\ ”
The newly added pumping well nodes appear in the “\ *Pumping Well*\ ”
dialog box (Figure 2.17).

.. figure:: media/figure_2_17_tutorial.png
   :width: 6.5in
   :height: 4.95in
   :align: center

   Figure 2.17 The “\ *Edit Pumping Wells*\ ” dialog box

Set the “\ *Type*\ ” as “\ *Pumping with LPE*\ ” for the first several
pumping wells (Figure 2.16 and Figure 2.17). Define the *“Screen Top”*
(initial screen top will be the ground-surface elevation), *“Screen
Bottom”* (initial screen bottom will be the selected node elevation),
LPE (*“Level”*), and pumping rate for all LPE wells. Choose a starting
time for pumping to begin; this may be one of the parameters used to
achieve dewatered conditions through the life of the mine. To turn
pumping off, set the pumping rate to -9,999,999 in the last pumping-rate
record of the dialog box. It is important that the last pumping-rate
record be a large negative number if pumping is to be turned off. If it
is not the last record or it is not a large negative number,
***MINEDW*** will not recognize that the well is to be turned off and
will continue to extract water at that well. Pumping in this tutorial
should end on or before the end of mining (Figure 2.17). If the pumping
rate changes with time, go to the lower right window shown in Figure
2.17 to include pumping rates for different times. Pumping-rate data can
be imported directly using the “\ *Import*\ ” function at the lower
right of the dialog box. The structure of the pumping rate file is
described in Appendix B.

.. figure:: media/figure_2_18_tutorial.png
   :width: 6.49in
   :height: 1.87in
   :align: center

   Figure 2.18 The “\ *Edit Pumping Wells*\ ” dialog box showing the
   pumping well types available in *MINEDW*

For “\ *Pumping Rate*\ ” wells, select “\ *Pumping Rate*\ ” under
“\ *Type*\ ” (Figure 2.18) and then enter the “\ *Screen Top*\ ” and
“\ *Screen Bottom*\ ” information. In the time-series window, choose
whether the pumping rate is “\ *Varied*,” “\ *Annual*,” or
“\ *Constant*\ ” and then enter the pumping-rate data. Pumping for the
tutorial model should end at the end of mining or before, so ensure that
the pumping rate is 0 on or before 1 January 2011.

*“Specified Head”* wells can be used to lower the head in the
groundwater system surrounding the well to a specified head level. This
feature is useful for predictive simulations in which the pump and well
must be designed to meet the dewatering objectives but the pumping rate
required to achieve the objective is unknown. To add “\ *Specified
Head*\ ” wells to the model, select “\ *Specified Head*\ ” under
“\ *Type*\ ” and then enter the information for “\ *Screen Top*\ ” and
“\ *Screen Bottom*\ ” and enter the specified head values in the rate
time-series window below. For this tutorial, the “\ *Specified Head*\ ”
wells will be deactivated on 1 January 2011 by entering “\ *-9,999,999”*
in the pumping-rate window located in the lower right of the *“Pumping
Well”* dialog box. Any pumping-rate information entered in the
pumping-rate window is ignored for *“Specified Head”* wells because
abstraction rates are estimated by the hydraulic properties of the
aquifer and hydraulic head at that point. The only value entered in the
pumping-rate box that is recognized by **MINEDW** for “\ *Specified
Head*\ ” wells is a large negative number, such as “\ *-9,999,999,”*
which will deactivate the “\ *Specified Head*\ ” well.

Step 9. Defining the Boundary Conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variable-Flux Boundary

A “\ *Variable-Flux*\ ” boundary condition is assigned from the top of
the model to the bottom along portions of the model domain. Ensure that
Layer 5 is selected by clicking on the “\ *Attributes*\ ” ab in the
“\ *Control Panel*\ ” pane, checking that “\ *Layer*\ ” is set to 5, as
shown in Figure 2.19.

From the **MINEDW** main menu, click the “\ *Select*\ ” button on the
Main Menu banner.

   Figure 2.20 The View Pane showing the first and last node of the
   variable-flux boundary

Select the beginning node (node at top left corner) and ending node (the
next node to the right) (Figure 2.20). The order of selection of the
nodes is important because **MINEDW** will assign the nodes between
the two selected nodes to the variable-flux boundary condition in a
counterclockwise direction. After selecting the two nodes, press
[Enter]. The “\ *Assign Properties for Nodes*\ ” dialog box appears
(Figure 2.21). Select “\ *Add to Variable-Flux Boundary*\ ” and check
the “\ *All nodes in between (counterclockwise)*\ ” box, as shown in
Figure 2.21 below. Enter “\ *32*\ ” or whatever layer is the bottom
layer in the “\ *From Current Layer #1 To*\ ” box on the right.

   :align: center

   Figure 2.21 The “\ *Assign Properties for Nodes*\ ” dialog box
   showing the “\ *Add to Variable-Flux Boundary*\ ” option selected

All nodes between the selected beginning node and ending node will be
selected and assigned as a variable-flux boundary condition. The
assignment will be for multiple layers since “\ *32*\ ” was entered as
the bottom layer, as shown in the dialog box above. Click “\ *OK.*\ ”

The flow rates from the constant-head boundary condition around the
perimeter of the model should be imported as flow rates for the
variable-flux boundary condition that was just added to the model. To do
this, click on *“BCs,”* then select *“Variable Flux”* to open the
*“Variable-Flux Boundary”* dialog box. At the bottom of the
*“Variable-Flux Boundary”* dialog box is the *“Import From DRN File”*
button. Click on this button to open the *“Open Variable Flux File”*
window. Use this window to browse to the location where the steady-state
simulation was conducted and select the file with the .DRN extension and
click *“Open.”* Flow rates for the variable-flux boundary condition will
be imported. Check the box next to *“Apply Constant Flux From Steady
State Simulation”* to apply the flow to the model simulation. Figure
2.22 shows the *“Variable-Flux Boundary”* dialog box with the imported
flow rates at the bottom of the dialog box.

   :align: center

   Figure 2.22 Imported flow rates

The next step will be to remove the constant-head boundary conditions
around the perimeter of the model domain that were used in the
steady-state simulation. The model should not have two types of boundary
conditions assigned to one node. To remove the perimeter constant-head
boundary condition, select the *“Constant Head”* item from the *“BCs”*
menu on the Main Menu banner. Using the *“Constant-Head Boundary”*
dialog box, select the *“MtBlock”* group from the *“Group Definition”*
drop-down box. Next, click the *“Delete”* button located at the top
center of the *“Constant-Head Boundary”* dialog box. A warning will
appear indicating that the group is not empty and will ask if the user
wishes to proceed. Click *“Yes,”* and this will delete this
constant-head group. Repeat these steps for the *“LowLand”* group, but
do not delete the *“Pond”* group.

2.2 Running the Model
---------------------

To run the model, click “\ *Run*\ ” on the Main Menu banner, then select
“\ *Validate.*\ ” If the model passes the validation process, click
“\ *Run*\ ” on the Main Menu banner and select “\ *Create Data Set*.”
Select the folder where you want to create the data set. A data set must
be created in order to run the model in **MINEDW**. Next, click
“\ *Run*\ ” on the Main Menu banner and select “\ *Execute*\ ” to run
the model. The following dialog box appears (Figure 2.23).

Creating Monitoring Points
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Model-calculated head values can be extracted using observations from
either monitoring boreholes or piezometers\ *.* Monitoring boreholes
will provide the head along a screened interval, while piezometers
provide the head at a single vertical point. Observation locations can
be defined by using the “\ *Observations*\ ” function under
“\ *Results.*\ ” When “\ *Observations*\ ” is selected from the
“\ *Results*\ ” drop-down menu, the “\ *Edit Observations*\ ” dialog box
appears (Figure 2.25). Select the “\ *Monitoring Borehole”* tab, click
“\ *Add*\ ” and enter the “\ *Name,*\ ” “\ *X*\ ” coordinate, “\ *Y*\ ”
coordinate, “\ *Screen Top,*\ ” and “\ *Screen Bottom*\ ” information
for each observation point as shown in the figure below, and then click
“\ *OK.*\ ” To add *“Piezometer”* observation points, click on the
*“Piezometer”* tab, then click *“Add”* at the top of the dialog box
(Figure 2.26). This will add a piezometer location, but observation
points, or “\ *Transducers”* as they are labeled in the legend, must be
specified too. Each piezometer may have multiple transducers, each with
its own X, Y, and Z coordinates. After adding a piezometer\ *,* click
*“Add”* in the middle of the dialog box (Figure 2.26) to add a
transducer. Define the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the transducer, then
click *“OK.”* It is also possible to import the observation points from
a text file that is space delimited. The observation file format is
provided in Appendix B of the **MINEDW** manual. The easiest way to
learn the file format that **MINEDW** requires is to first create one
by defining a *“Monitoring Borehole”* and *“Piezometer”* and then
exporting to a “\*.DAT” file. This can be done by clicking the
“\ *Export”* button at the bottom of the *“Edit Observations”* dialog
box.

Pit Lake – Water Level vs. Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The water-level change in a pit lake can also be computed in
**MINEDW**. To plot pit-lake level changes through time, import the
“\ *PITLEV.LAK*\ ” file from the folder where **MINEDW** was executed
into Microsoft\ :sup:`®` Excel. Figure 2.41 shows the pit-lake level
changes through time. When analyzing the water levels in the pit lake,
use only the water level *after* the pit lake begins to form and the
water level begins to rise.

   Figure 2.41 Pit-lake level changes through time

Pumping Wells – Discharge vs. Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Discharge through time from pumping wells is recorded in the
“\*.\ *FLW*\ ” file by **MINEDW**. The discharge rate for “\ *Pumping
with LPE”* or *“Specified Head”* wells, unlike *“Pumping Rate”* wells,
is calculated during the model run. To plot pumping-rate data through
time, import the “\*.\ *FLW*\ ” file into Microsoft\ :sup:`®` Excel or
other plotting software and select the data for the desired pumping
wells.

Particle Tracking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Particle tracking can be used to determine the capture zone of a well or
the fate of groundwater within a zone of interest. To evaluate the
capture zone of a well, backward particle tracking should be used, while
forward particle tracking can be used to predict the fate of groundwater
within a zone of interest. The examples provided below and in the
“\ *INPUT/PARTICLE TRACKING*\ ” directory employ both forward and
reverse particle tracking.

To set up reverse particle tracking, choose points along the well screen
of any one of the simulated pumping wells. The “\ *INPUT/PARTICLE
TRACKING*\ ” directory contains two files, *“P9\_points.DAT”* and
*“P15\_points.DAT,”* that contain points centered along the simulated
screens for two pumps in this tutorial that can be used as a starting
point to construct reverse particle tracks. Open the *“Particle
Tracking”* dialog box by clicking on *“Results”* on the Main Menu banner
and selecting *“Particle Tracking.”* For each of the fields in the
*“Particle Tracking”* dialog box, enter the values shown in Figure 2.42.
Alternatively, an input file containing all of the necessary parameters
for particle tracking is included in the “\ *INPUT/PARTICLE TRACKING*\ ”
directory. To use this file to populate the required fields in the
*“Particle Tracking”* dialog box, click on *“Open”* at the bottom center
of the dialog box. Navigate to the location of the “\ *INPUT/PARTICLE
TRACKING*\ ” directory using the *“Open Particle Tracking File*\ ”
dialog box, select the file *“P9 & P15\_INPUT (reverse).dat,”* and click
*“Open.”* The *“Particle Tracking”* dialog box should now appear with
all the fields filled in except *“Result Output,”* as shown in Figure
2.42. Enter a file name for the output or, to select a different
directory from “\ *INPUT/PARTICLE TRACKING*\ ” in which to create the
output file, click on the button above and browse to the desired
location. Once the output file name and/or directory have been
specified, click *“OK”* at the bottom of the *“Particle Tracking”*
dialog box to begin the particle tracking calculations.

   Figure 2.42 Parameters for reverse particle tracking from a pumping
   well

Once **MINEDW** has finished the particle tracking calculations, the
particle tracks can be visualized in the View Pane by adding a
*“Particle Tracking”* plot item. From the *“List”* tab in the *“Control
Panel”* pane, double-click on *“Post Processing”* and then double-click
on *“Particle Tracking.”* Click on the empty field next to the *“File”*
attribute on the *“Attributes”* tab for the *“Particle Tracking”* plot
item. Using the *“Select particle tracking file”* dialog box that opens,
navigate to the location where the particle tracking file was created by
**MINEDW,** select the file, and click *“Open.”*

The particle tracks may not immediately display depending on the
currently selected time step. Using the time-step slider at the top of
**MINEDW,** change the time step to the date selected as the start
date for the reverse particle tracks. Results similar to those shown in
Figure 2.43 below should display. This same process can be followed to
evaluate the capture zone of any one of the wells used in a simulation.

   Figure 2.43 Reverse particle tracking results for two pumping wells

Forward particle tracking can be used to evaluate if groundwater from a
particular region is captured by pumping wells in the model. To perform
forward particle tracking, locate the file named *“Region\_points.dat”*
in the directory INPUT/PARTICLE TRACKING. This file contains a group of
points located slightly upgradient of the pumping well field in this
tutorial. For simplicity, use these points and the particle tracking
input file named *“Region\_INPUT (forward).dat”* to populate the
“\ *Particle Tracking”* dialog box as described in the previous example.
Once all of the fields of the “\ *Particle Tracking”* dialog box have
been filled in, run the particle tracking calculation by clicking
*“OK.”* Next, add a “\ *Particle Tracking”* plot item to the View Pane
and select the recently created particle track file. Figure 2.44 shows
the results of particle tracking for the points in the *“Region\_INPUT
(forward).dat”* file.

   simulated well field

Only the particles placed within the zones of higher hydraulic
conductivity are captured by the pumping wells. The lower geologic units
have hydraulic conductivities several orders of magnitude lower than the
upper units. Repeat the particle tracking exercise for any desired
location by repeating the steps described above.
