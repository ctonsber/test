5.0 Mesh Generator
==================

In order to build a **MINEDW** model, the user must first create a 2-D
mesh using either the Grasshopper plugin for *Rhinoceros 3D* (*Rhino*, a
3-D modeling program) that is distributed with **MINEDW** or any other
software designed to create a 2-D mesh. The 2-D mesh needs to be saved
as either a stereolithography (.STL) file or a **MINEDW** geometry
(.PST) file. The 2-D mesh file can then be imported to the main
**MINEDW** GUI where the rest of the model setup occurs.

5.1 Creating a Mesh
-------------------

For the creation of a mesh, *Rhino* should be installed. After the
successful installation of *Rhino*, copy the “MMesh.gha” and
“triangulation.dll” files that were provided in the “\ *bin*\ ”
directory of the installed directory of **MINEDW** into the directory
“C:\\Users\\[\ *YOUR USER NAME]*\\Application
Data\\Grasshopper\\Libraries.”

Open *Rhino* and import or create any features you would like to include
in your mesh. This can be done using the *Rhino* drawing tools or by
importing or copying from *AutoCAD* .DXF files. Launch Grasshopper by
typing “\ *Grasshopper*\ ” into the *Rhino* command line, or
double-click the “\ *Launch Grasshopper*\ ” tool icon to open the
Grasshopper window.

From the Grasshopper window, open the “template.gh” file that is in the
“\ *bin*\ ” directory of the installed **MINEDW** directory. A
workflow will appear on the Grasshopper canvas, shown in Figure 5.1
This workflow is designed to create a 2-D mesh for a typical
mining-related groundwater flow model. The workflow may be modified
using the tools contained in *Rhino* and Grasshopper to suit any
requirements.

*Rhino* and Grasshopper are two powerful external visualization and
mesh-generation tools that are not developed by Itasca. Users are
strongly encouraged to read the operational manuals of *Rhino* and
Grasshopper to become familiar with these tools.

The user is also recommended to work through tutorials for mesh
generation using *Rhino* and Grasshopper.

   Figure 5.1 The Grasshopper mesh generator template

The blocks shown in Figure 5-1 are called components. Each of the key
components is labeled by number and will be explained in detail in
Section 5.2 Components have input parameters on their left side and
output parameters on their right side. A component box is orange in
color if it has a warning message. The message can be viewed in the
comment box on top of the component. The user assigns features such as
rivers, wells, and faults to components in Grasshopper to add features
to the mesh. The grey “\ *All Faults*\ ” and “\ *Regions*\ ” (6 & 7)
components are used to combine multiple inputs of the same type. The
grey slider blocks, if connected to another component’s input parameter,
allow the user to adjust parameters such as maximum element area and
fault width. The “\ *MMesh*\ ” (8) component creates a mesh that
incorporates all the components it is connected to. The yellow box below
the “\ *MMesh*\ ” component gives information about the mesh, including
the number of vertices and elements and the minimum element size once it
is created. Components may be connected by clicking on the half circle
next to an input parameter and dragging the mouse to the half circle
next to an output parameter. Components may be disconnected by
right-clicking on a parameter at either end of the connection and
choosing the “\ *Disconnect*\ ” option. Once the components have been
connected and assigned with the proper construction features, the mesh
can be viewed and will dynamically update as changes are made to various
components. The components and the steps involved in making a mesh are
discussed in detail in the following sections.

5.2 The Mesh Components
-----------------------

The template contains the following components, which are labeled by
number in Figure 5.1:

1.  **Domain**: This component is used to define the extent of the model
    domain. The input will be a single, closed polyline curve.

2.  **Mining Area, Mining, and Fine Area:** These components are used to
    outline regions of the model domain that will have a finer mesh
    discretization. The input will be one or more closed polyline
    curves.

3.  **Fault**: This component is used to define any faults in the model
    domain. The mesh generator will ensure that model nodes follow the
    line of the fault and will apply a width of the fault for a more
    accurate geologic representation. The user may specify the width of
    a fault. The input for this feature is a curve that represents the
    centerline of the fault.

4.  **Points:** This component is used to specify any points that need
    to correspond to nodes in the mesh, such as a pumping well. The
    input for this feature is one or more points.

5.  **Polylines:** This component is used to specify any curves that
    need to correspond to edges in the mesh, such as rivers or streams.
    There is no width associated with this feature. The input for this
    feature is one or more curves.

6.  **Regions:** This component combines all the mesh regions created in
    the “\ *Mesh Regions*\ ” group. The output of this component is
    connected to the regions input parameter of the “\ *MMesh*\ ”
    component.

7.  **All Faults:** This component combines all the faults created in
    the “\ *Faults with Different Widths*\ ” group. The output of this
    component is connected to the faults input parameter of the
    “\ *MMesh*\ ” component.

8.  **MMesh:** This component receives input parameters from the
    regions, faults, lines, and points that the user specifies and then
    generates a mesh. Information about the mesh appears in the yellow
    box.

9.  **Toggle:** This component toggles between “\ *True*\ ” and
    “\ *False*\ ” values. The output of this component is connected to
    the “\ *Simplify Lines*\ ” parameter: If the value is “\ *True*,”
    “\ *MMesh*\ ” will simplify line inputs into the mesh; if the value
    is false, “\ *MMesh*\ ” does not simplify line inputs.

10. **Area Tolerance:** This component specifies the minimum ratio
    between the actual area of an element and the maximum area
    assigned to the mesh region it belongs to.

The user must import or create each feature in *Rhino* prior to
connecting the features to the Grasshopper workflow. Note that all
features must be located in the same 2-D plane. To connect features that
exist in the *Rhino* workbook to the Grasshopper workflow, right-click
on the input parameter in the top left corner of the component block and
choose “\ *Set One Curve/Point*\ ” or “\ *Set Multiple Curves/Points*.”
Then select the desired feature in *Rhino*. This process is described in
detail for each type of component in the following sections.

For the “\ *Mesh Regions*\ ” components, in the purple box in the upper
left of the Grasshopper worksheet, all active components must be
connected to the “\ *Regions*\ ” component. The “\ *Regions*\ ”
component must then be connected to “\ *MMesh*\ ” at the terminal
labeled “\ *Regions.*\ ”

5.2.1 The “Domain” Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *Domain*\ ” component (Figure 5.2) is used to specify the model
domain boundary. All parts of the mesh must be contained within the
model domain boundary. The input for this component must be a closed
polyline curve. Note that curves that the user draws in *Rhino* may be
non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) curves. NURBS curves cannot be
used in the Grasshopper workflow but may be easily converted to
polylines using the “\ *Convert*\ ” command in the *Rhino* command line.
See the *Rhino* documentation for more information. To connect a closed
curve in the *Rhino* workbook to the “\ *Domain*\ ” component in
Grasshopper, right-click on the “\ *Domain*\ ” input parameter in the
upper left of the component (Figure 5.2a). Select “\ *Set One Curve*\ ”
(Figure 5.2b). Then select the curve that delineates the model domain
boundary in the *Rhinoceros* window.

The user can check that the desired curve was connected to the
“\ *Domain*\ ” component by clicking on the “\ *Domain*\ ” component so
that it is highlighted in green. In the *Rhino* workbook, any curve that
is assigned to the highlighted component will turn green. Curves may be
disconnected from the “\ *Domain*\ ” component by right-clicking on the
“\ *Domain*\ ” input parameter and selecting the “\ *Clear Values*\ ”
option in the “\ *Domain”* menu, shown in Figure 5.2b.

   Figure 5.2 The “\ *Domain*\ ” component: a) the component, b) the
   “\ *Domain*\ ” input parameter menu, c) the “\ *Area*\ ” input parameter
   menu

The maximum element area is set in two ways depending on whether the
“\ *Maximum Area*\ ” block and “\ *Area*\ ” link in the “\ *Domain*\ ”
block are connected or not.

If the “\ *Maximum Area*\ ” block and “\ *Area*\ ” link in the
“\ *Domain*\ ” block are not connected, the user can right-click on the
“\ *Area*\ ” input parameter, which brings up the menu shown in Figure
5.2c. Click on the “\ *Set Number*\ ” menu option and enter the maximum
element size desired for the mesh; note that the user will have the
ability to add regions of finer discretization.

If the “\ *Maximum Area*\ ” block and “\ *Area*\ ” link in the
“\ *Domain*\ ” block are connected, it also is only possible to set the
maximum element area by connecting the grey slider to the left of the
component, shown in Figure 5.3 The user can either use the slider to
determine the value of the maximum area or double-click the grey area
and enter the value.

It should be noted that if the “\ *Maximum Area*\ ” block is connected
to the “\ *Area*\ ” link of the “\ *Domain*\ ” block, the value in the
“\ *Maximum Area*\ ” block will supersede the value that is entered in
the “\ *Area*\ ” parameter in the “\ *Domain*\ ” block.

Blocks may be connected by clicking on the half circle of the
“\ *Maximum Area*\ ” block and dragging the mouse to the half circle of
the “\ *Area*\ ” parameter in the “\ *Domain*\ ” block. Blocks maybe
disconnected by right-clicking the specific parameter in the
“\ *Domain*\ ” block (i.e., “\ *Area*\ ” in Figure 5.3) and selecting
“\ *Disconnect*\ ” from the pop-up menu.

5.2.2 The “Mining Area,” “Mining,” and “Fine Area” Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *Mining Area*,” “\ *Mining*,” and “\ *Fine Area*\ ” components
are intended to allow the user to assign regions of increased mesh
density to the area surrounding the mining activities, the location of
the mining activities themselves, and any other areas that require it.
The regions that the user assigns to any of these three components must
be contained within the model domain that the user specified in the
“\ *Domain*\ ” component. These regions of fine mesh discretization may
be located completely inside or completely outside of another fine mesh
discretization region; however, they cannot partially overlap.

The “\ *Mining Area*,” “\ *Mining*,” and “\ *Fine Area*\ ” components
are used in the same way as the “\ *Domain*\ ” component. The user
right-clicks on the “\ *Region*\ ” input parameter and selects the menu
option “\ *Set One Curve*\ ” or “\ *Set Multiple Curves*\ ” (see Figure
5.2b). The user then selects the curve or curves that delineate the
region that requires a finer mesh. The user may specify the maximum
element area in the region by right-clicking on the “\ *Area*\ ” input
parameter and selecting “\ *Set Number*\ ” from the menu. Alternatively,
the user may set the maximum element size by connecting the “\ *Area*\ ”
input to the “\ *Maximum Area*\ ” slider and using the slider to select
the desired maximum element size, as shown in Figure 5.3, or enter the
value as described in Section 5.2.1.

5.2.3 The “Fault” Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *Fault*\ ” component (Figure 5.4a) is used to create faults that
have width. The user must first create or import a curve that delineates
the center line of a fault in *Rhino*. The user right-clicks on the
“\ *Line*\ ” input parameter and selects the menu option “\ *Select One
Curve*,” shown in Figure 5.4b. The user then selects the desired curve
in *Rhino*. The user may also select the “\ *Select Multiple Curves*\ ”
option and then select all the faults that have the same width. If
different widths are desired, the user must use multiple “\ *Fault”*
components. To disconnect curves, select the “\ *Clear Values*\ ” option
in the “\ *Line*\ ” input parameter menu, shown in Figure 5.4b.

   Figure 5.4 The *“Fault*\ ” component: a) the component, b) the
   “\ *Line*\ ” input parameter menu, c) the “\ *Width*\ ” input parameter
   menu.

The width of the fault is specified for each “\ *Fault*\ ” component by
right-clicking on the “\ *Width*\ ” input parameter and selecting the
menu option “\ *Set Number*,” then entering the desired fault width.
This is shown in Figure 5.4c. Alternatively, the user may connect the
“\ *Width*\ ” slider, shown in Figure 5.5, to the “\ *Width*\ ” input
parameter and then use the slider to specify the desired fault width.
Note that if the slider is connected, the “\ *Set Number”* option will
be greyed out.

5.2.4 The “Points” Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *Points*\ ” component (Figure 5.6a) allows the user to specify
points that will correspond to vertices in the mesh. This is typically
used for pumping wells or monitoring wells so that the code’s
calculation point will exactly match the location of the point feature.
To specify hard points, the user right-clicks on the “\ *Points*\ ”
component and then selects either “\ *Set One Point*\ ” or “\ *Set
Multiple Points*,” shown in Figure 5.6. The user then selects the
desired point or points in the *Rhino* workbook. The “SelPt” command may
be used to select all points in the Rhino workbook. The command line
will say “\ *Point object to reference (Type=Point)*,” where the type is
“\ *Coordinate*\ ” or “\ *Point*.” If the type is “\ *Coordinate*,”
Grasshopper will save the coordinates of the points at the time it is
connected to the Grasshopper workflow. If the point is moved later,
Grasshopper will not update its location. When the “\ *Point*\ ” type is
used, Grasshopper will update the mesh if the point is moved later.

5.2.5 The “Polylines” Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Curves assigned to the “\ *Polylines*\ ” component will correspond to
mesh edges. This is typically used for rivers or other features that are
represented as curves and do not have a width assigned to them. The
component is shown in Figure 5.7a. To specify a hard curve, right-click
on the “\ *Polylines*\ ” component and select the “\ *Set One Curve*\ ”
or “\ *Set Multiple Curves*\ ” option, as in Figure 5.7b. Select the
curve or curves that delineate the desired hard curves.

5.2.6 The “Regions” Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *Regions”* component receives the outputs from each component in
the “\ *Mesh Regions*\ ” group, merges them together, and outputs the
result to the “\ *MMesh*\ ” component. The component is shown in Figure
5.8.

   Figure 5.8 The “\ *Regions*\ ” component

5.2.7 The “All Faults” Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *All Faults*\ ” component receives the outputs from each
component in the “\ *Faults with Different Widths*\ ” group, merges them
together, and outputs the result to the *“MMesh*\ ” component. The
component is shown in Figure 5.9.

   :height: 1.30417in
   :align: center

   Figure 5.9 The “\ *All Faults*\ ” component

5.2.8 The “MMesh” Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *MMesh*\ ” component, shown in Figure 5.10, receives outputs from
the “\ *Regions,*\ ” “\ *Points*,” “\ *Polylines*,” and “\ *Faults*\ ”
components discussed above. In addition, “\ *MMesh*\ ” has an “\ *Area
Tolerance*\ ” input parameter, which is the ratio of the smallest
permissible area to the corresponding maximum area constraint. There is
also a “\ *Simplify Lines*\ ” input parameter, which receives a Boolean
value from the “\ *Toggle*\ ” component. If the value is “\ *True*,” all
polyline inputs will be simplified, meaning the number of control points
will be reduced and redistributed. This is recommended if there is a
small angle between curve features. Both the *“Area Tolerance”* and
*“Toggle”* components are discussed in further detail in the following
sections.

.. figure:: media/figure_5_10_manual.png

   :height: 2.69583in
   :align: center

   Figure 5.10 The “\ *MMesh*\ ” component

5.2.9 The “Toggle” Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user assigns either a “\ *True*\ ” or a “\ *False*\ ” value to the
“\ *Toggle”* component. In the Grasshopper workflow shown in Figure 5.1,
the toggle output is connected to the “\ *Simplify Lines*\ ” input
parameter in the “\ *MMesh*\ ” component. Here, the “\ *Toggle*\ ”
component allows the user to choose whether or not the “\ *MMesh*\ ”
component simplifies any line inputs or not; “\ *True*\ ” means that
lines are simplified, and “\ *False*\ ” means that lines are not
simplified.

5.2.10 The “Area Tolerance” Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *Area Tolerance*\ ” component specifies the minimum value of the
ratio between an element’s area and the maximum area specified for the
region of the mesh that the element belongs to. The “\ *MMesh*\ ”
routine attempts to create elements that are as close as possible to the
maximum element area specified by the user. If the “\ *MMesh*\ ” routine
is not able to create elements that are large enough to meet the area
tolerance criteria, it will disregard hard points so that it can.
Therefore, if a curve has too many control points in one section, or if
there is a cluster of wells too close together to allow for element
sizes to meet the area tolerance criteria, the “\ *MMesh*\ ” routine may
disregard points that the user specified to match with mesh nodes.

5.3 Exporting a Completed Mesh
------------------------------

During the development of the mesh in Grasshopper, the mesh is shown as
a preview that cannot be selected or modified in the *Rhino* workbook.
Once the mesh is completed, the user may save the mesh in the *Rhino*
workbook by right-clicking on the “\ *MMesh”* component and selecting
the “\ *Bake…”* menu option, shown in Figure 5.11a. The user will be
able to enter the name of the mesh and choose the layer it will be found
in in the resulting menu, shown in Figure 5.11b.

   :align: center

   Figure 5.11 Saving a mesh: a) the “\ *MMesh*\ ” component menu, b) the
   “\ *Save Attributes*\ ” dialog box

In the *Rhino* workbook, the user can use the design tools to edit the
mesh, if necessary. To export the mesh in a format compatible with
**MINEDW**, first select the mesh, then choose “\ *Export Selected…”*
in the “\ *File*\ ” menu. Save the file as a stereolithography, or .STL,
file.

5.4 The Rhino “Drop” Command
----------------------------

The “\ *Drop*\ ” command in *Rhino* was developed to aid the creation of
open-pit plans. The command allows the user to find the elevation of the
pit at many x, y points without loss of accuracy due to interpolation.
To install the function, go to the “\ *File*\ ” menu and select the
“\ *Properties*\ ” option. The “\ *Document Properties*\ ” dialog box
shown in Figure 5.12 will open. Chose the option “\ *Plug-ins*\ ” from
the list on the left side of the “\ *Document Properties*\ ” dialog box,
circled in Figure 5.12 Click the “\ *Install*\ ” button and choose the
“Drop.rhp” file. Make sure that “\ *Drop*\ ” is listed under “\ *All
Plug-ins*\ ” and that the “\ *Enabled*\ ” box next to it is checked, as
shown in Figure 5.12.

   :align: center

   Figure 5.12 Installing the “\ *Drop*\ ” command in *Rhino*

To use the function, open a mesh in *Rhino*. Import points to *Rhino*;
the user may want the points to match the *x*, *y* locations of the
model mesh’s nodes. Type “\ *Drop*\ ” into the command window and,
following the prompts, select the mesh, press [Enter], select the
points, and press [Enter] again. The points will keep their *x* and *y*
coordinates but change in elevation such that they are located on the
mesh. The points may be selected and then exported from *Rhino* as a
text file. The text file may then be imported into **MINEDW** for
various uses.
