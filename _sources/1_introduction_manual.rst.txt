1.0 Introduction
================

For mining operations that are conducted below the water table, there
are two important water-related problems that mine operators could face:
groundwater inflow into an underground excavation or an open pit if the
country rock is relatively permeable or, if the rock is impermeable,
pore pressure affecting the stability of open-pit highwalls or
underground excavation. For economic and safety purposes, it is
important to be able to predict the nature and magnitude of these
potential problems so that appropriate dewatering or depressurizing
systems may be installed.

Numerical groundwater flow models are now routinely used to predict
inflows and pore-pressure distributions for both open-pit and
underground mines and to help design mine dewatering systems. Although
adequate for addressing broad issues such as the impact of mining
operations on regional water resources, available groundwater numerical
codes are limited in their ability to quantify the more detailed
problems of the phreatic surface in highwalls and inflows to both open
pits and underground openings. These limitations arise primarily from
the following:

-  How the flow domain is subdivided into finite, geometric pieces—the
   discretiza­tion used in a numerical model—could strongly affect the
   predictions of inflow and the shape of the phreatic surface near an
   excavation. Not only must discrete features, such as faults and
   contacts between different hydrogeologic materials, be included in
   the discretization, but predicting the essentially radial flow toward
   an excavation is more accurately performed by using small,
   approximately logarithmic mesh spacing. Finite-difference codes have
   an inherent limitation relative to finite-element discretization when
   applied to any problem that is hydrogeologically or geometrically
   complex.

-  The seepage face—the surface of the highwall of an open pit through
   which lateral flow occurs—is usually not properly estimated in most
   commonly used finite-difference codes. The height of the seepage face
   affects both the amount of lateral inflow and the height of the water
   table behind the highwall. A poor estimate of the height of the
   seepage face can introduce significant errors to the predicted
   inflows and pore pressures.

-  For slope-stability analysis, it is critical that the output of the
   pore pressure can be readily used in the geomechanical model. The
   pore pressure data from the groundwater flow model that are not
   compatible with the data requirements of the geomechanical model will
   delay the integration between these two models.

To overcome limitations such as those described above, Itasca Denver,
Inc. (Itasca) developed **MINEDW**, a three-dimensional (3-D),
finite-element groundwater flow code. The core of the code is based on
algorithms previously developed by Durbin and Berenbrock [I]_ 
for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) code 
`FEMFLOW3D <https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr97810>`_. As of early
2018, **MINEDW** has been used successfully at more than 50 mines
located throughout the world and in diverse hydrogeologic and climatic
conditions. The code has been in use for approximately 30 years, and its
predictions have been validated by field data collected over many years.

Since Itasca first commercially released **MINEDW** in 2012, Itasca
has continued to improve the functionality of **MINEDW**. The current
version, **MINEDW** 3.05, represents over 20 years of development and
is commercially available.

Itasca would like to acknowledge the contributions from the past and
current employees of Itasca and its predecessor, Hydrologic Consulting,
Inc. Among them, Mr. Timothy Durbin and Dr. Lee Atkinson were
instrumental in the inception and early development of **MINEDW**.
